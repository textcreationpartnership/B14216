            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Sacred Majestie, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made some exposition upon the Proverbs of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> I have now done the same upon his Preaching. For seeing so great a King was pleased to be a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, I have brought the homage of a Preacher to him. My former labours received the honour of Patronage from your Royall Brother, my dread Soveraigne, to whom the God of mercy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be a gratious Patron, and a safe defender: these labours most humbly beseech the same from your Sacred Majestie. For seeing, when I was your ordinary Chaplaine, I had long and often in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding other parts of Scripture, the gracious attention of your hearing, I desire that the world may read these with the favourable light of your Patronage. It is but a beame of that illustrious and
<pb facs="tcp:177008:3"/> splendent light shining in you which I crave, and which though clouded with many trials, yet breaks out gloriously in heavenly patience, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cheerfulnesse, divine courage, noble courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. To put these, and many other graces in one, God hath made you, the onely Daughter of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous King deceased, the only Sister of a glorious King alive, that all might looke upon you to his greater glory. And he that hath made you the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his praise for others to looke upon, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe himselfe to looke upon you as the object of his graciousnesse. He that is the only wise God be your pretious comforter: he that is the only Sonne of God be your mercifull Saviour, and make you glorious in the happinesse of heaven, who hath made you so glorious in the troubles of the earth.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, to make ashort commentary upon mine owne mind in publishing this commentary upon the Booke of <hi>Ecclesiastes:</hi> I desire that God may be glorified by the knowledge of his Word, and that the Church of God may be illightned in the knowledge of it, and that the discharge of my duety to the Church might be in some sort expressed. For though the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be the firmament of the Church, in which the Sun of truth shineth, the Moone of knowledge is in her full brightnesse, and where there are a multitude of starres of most excellent and divine light; yet such are the clouds of humane ignorance, such the mists of our corrupted nature, that we perceive but darkly the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and glory of them. If therefore such means be used, as that these clouds may be in some measure cleared, and the thicknesse of these mists in some part lesned, it is not a labour that needeth to be judged of, as needlesly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed. As for this booke of the Preacher, such is the blindnesse of the eyes of many in the reading of it, that mistaking utterly his heavenly meaning, from hence they frame pretences for their owne earthly and voluptuous living. But such also are many passages of this booke,
<pb facs="tcp:177008:4"/> that even they who have the sharpest sight, must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a dimnesse of their eyes when they looke upon them. Where if my small candle hath given any light, the whole praise be given unto the Father of lights: if it hath cast a false light, I presume that they who discerne it, will not be misled by it, I hope that they who discerne it, shall receive no hurt by it. For though we may not walke in the way of a right understanding, in all things, yet if we doe walke in the way of a right faith, and of a godly life, we shall be sure not to misse the way unto eternall life, which God of his mercy grant to us all for his Sonne Jesus Christs sake. The faults of the printing had not been so many and great, had mine health beene greater, that I could have lookd after it. But let thy courtesie be the physicke to cure them, and for many of them there is a remedy set downe in the end of the booke, where seeing thou mayest easily correct them, be not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to condemne them.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He greatest labour of Philosophers hath been to finde out the greatest good of man; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what hath their labour been, but a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, in which themselves being lost, they were farre from finding that which they sought? But this being the scope of the Royall Philosopher, the Ecclesiasticall King of Israel in this Booke, he shews where it is, by shewing it not to be in the things of this world: he declareth what it is, by declaring what wee must be in the feare of the Lord, and in keeping his Commandements. It is a mistake, as some thinke,<note place="margin">Picolomine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> of the meaning of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> to imagine that he placed the chiefe good of man in a sensuall pleasure; but that he intended the sweet delight of vertue, and therein the happy contentment of mans minde, to be the bed of rest unto it. Now much more are they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, who thinke that in this book a luxurious pleasure is commended to us: seeing it is from a discommendation of worldly things, in respect of the vanitie of them,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in Ecclesiast.</note>
                  <hi>Et quae dum tenentur, intereunt,</hi> and which are still in loosing even while they are kept, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh, that the Preacher laboureth to make us to deny the world: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and to seate the minde above a sensuall contentment, as a Greek Father expresseth the purpose of this booke. The things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the vanitie is here weighed unto us, are by <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced unto three heads, as being, <hi>Aut quae propter homines facta sunt, aut quae ab hominibus facta sunt, aut quae in hominibus facta sunt,</hi> Either those

And therefore in the end of the booke, as it were speaking unto all, in whose words he had spoken, and shutting up their many words in a few, but containing the whole truth,<note place="margin">

But seeing to the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> to the King of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (or else the King in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as the Originall more directly is) is added the Preacher; <hi>Forte ad ducem ecclesiae intuetur inscriptio,</hi> perhaps the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription casteth an eye to him who is the Captaine and Leader of his Church, (as a Greeke Father speaketh) to <hi>Christ,</hi> who is indeede the Preacher of righteousnesse, who is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 2. After the three titles of the Authour, <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> conceiveth <hi>Solomon,</hi> to set downe the summe of the three parts of his book in the three following verses. In this verse the vanitie of mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which is handled from the first verse unto the twelfth verse of this Chapter: in the next verse, the vanitie of curiositie or desire, which is handled from the twelfth verse of this Chap. unto the twelfth Chapter: in the following verses, the vanitie of mortalitie, which is handled from the beginning of the twelfth Chapter to the end of it, and of the booke. The same Authour speaking of these vanities sayth;<note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. in Ecclesiast.</note>
                     <hi>Prima vanitas na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis est, &amp; apta sive congrua: secunda vanitas culpabilis est quia perversa: tertia vanitas poenalis &amp; misera. Prima causa est peccati; secunda peccatum; tertia poena peccati;</hi> The first vanitie is naturall, and fit for the nature of worldly things; the second is sinfull, because perverse and froward; the third penall and miserable. The first is the occasion of sinne, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is sinne, the third is the punishment of sinne. But to consider the verse in it selfe. <hi>The Preacher</hi> which is the first of the titles in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verse, is here the onely title of the Authour, as shewing that to be his proper title as Authour of this booke. Or else it sheweth that in his repentance, he esteemed this title above all: and that he thought this to be more glorious unto him, then that he was either the sonne of so great a King, or else so great a King himselfe. An ancient Writer sayth of this part of the verse, <hi>Sayth the Preacher, Cum pondere pronuntiandum est,</hi> that it is to be pronounced with a weighty emphasis. He sayth it, who in his sinfull folly did not consider it: he sayth it, who hath sayd so much of so many things: he sayth it, who being the Sonne of a wise King, was himselfe the wisest King that ever was or shall be. <hi>Quod ergo tantus, &amp; talis dixit, vanum esse non potuit, etiamsi de vanitate dixit,</hi> Wherefore that which one so great, and such a one hath sayd, cannot be vaine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he hath sayd it of vanitie. But if <hi>all things be vanitie,</hi> then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe also, who spake this, is vanitie. And if vanitie speake, what can it be but vaine that is spoken? To answer this: it was not himselfe in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this that spake, it was the spirit of God that gave him utterance. And therefore <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> sayth, <hi>Vbi putatis mens erat hujus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, quum haec diceret? Homo erat, sed supra hominem erat. Quia nisi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem excederet, omnem hominem mendacem esse non videret?</hi> Where doe yee thinke was the minde of this man, when he sayd these things? He was a man, but yet above a man: because unlesse he did exceed a man, he could not have seene that all men are vanitie. But to consider what he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177008:7"/> sayth, what the Spirit of God meaneth by <hi>vanitie,</hi> the Spirit of God can best tell us:<note place="margin">

The <hi>vanitie</hi> then whereof the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher speaketh, is the lying promises of contentment which worldly things make, and the no-profit which is made of them. <hi>Vanitie of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, sayth the Preacher,</hi> that is, the vanitie of them, is even more then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: and as if he would say more, but could not, he sayth the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: and least he should not have sayd all, yet he addeth, <hi>All is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, that in all translations besides the Septuagint, the words are rendred <gap reason="foreign">

But doth not this redound to the dishonour of the Creatour, if all things created by him in this world be so strangely vaine? <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> apprehendeth,<note place="margin">Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexan. strom. l. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> that it was from a mistake of the meaning of this verse, that <hi>Epicurus</hi> affirmed, <hi>Omnia temere ferri,</hi> All things to be caried lightly and vainely.

Which is indeed most true, but I conceive the Preachers speech to intend rather the vanities of mans life, then to be uttered of the creatures generally. But having considered, who it is that sayth it, what it is that is sayd, I will say no more, but that which S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh of this verse,<note place="margin">Chrysost.

If that be temporary which he hath made who is eternall, what is that which he maketh, who is himselfe temporary? <hi>What hath he more?</hi> What more of all his labour, then the labour it selfe, then his labour for his paines? St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and St. <hi>Aust.</hi> doe reade it, <hi>Quae abundantia?</hi> What abundance is there to a man of all his worldly labour? yea although he be abundant in his labour: yea although it be not only the early labour of the morning, but that labour which endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the heate of the day, and is <hi>under the Sunne:</hi> yea although wee consider not only that labour which a man hath taken, or still taketh, but that also which hee shall take (for so the Originall is) even as long as the Sunne is up, and till the Sunne of his life be set, even of all his labour, what great matter, and worthy to bee regarded ariseth from it?

The Preacher therefore only saith, <hi>One generation passeth away, and another commeth.</hi> The originall doth expresse it selfe by a participle, and thereby sheweth, that it doth not only passe away, as it were when the time commeth, but is continually passing away, and never abideth, which as it maketh the vanity the more, so it is still made more, in that <hi>the earth abideth for ever.</hi> The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is so much beneath man, that element which a man trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth under his feete. (For as the latine word <hi>terra,</hi> is taken <hi>a terendo</hi> from breaking and wearing, so the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> which signifieth to breake and to weare also,) even the earth which is trampled on abideth, when man passeth away. Man was made of the earth, yet man vanisheth, and the earth continueth: the earth was made for man, yet man passeth away and the earth standeth still. The earth standeth, and standeth <hi>in testimonium &amp; poenam culpae hominis,</hi> for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of mans sinne, and punishment, bringing forth bryars and thornes unto him. The earth standeth, and standeth up an accuser a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst man. For so <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Olympiodor. in Ecclesiast.</note>
                     <hi>Terra quidem in perpetuum stat, accusatrix vestra effecta, in qua nefaria opera purpetrastis,</hi> The earth indeed standeth for ever, being made an accuser against y, for the evill deeds which yee have committed in it.

                     </note> But doth the earth stand for ever? If we take it, in a mystery for the Church, as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> doth, then most true it is, that it abideth for ever, <hi>Quia sancta

But to keepe to the letter.<note place="margin">Tremellius in hunc vers.</note> The earth is said <hi>to abide for ever,</hi> in respect of the vanity and shortnesse of mans life, which is so quickly gone.

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. The generall exposition among the Ancients given of this Verse, and of the two following, is, that by the vanity of these creatures is set forth the vanity of man.<note place="margin">Greg. Nys. in Ecclesiast. Hom. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> And therefore <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> saith, <hi>O homines qui universitatem aspicitis, vestram ipsorum naturam intelligite,</hi> O men who doe behold the universe, understand your owne nature in it, <hi>Est ad solis similitudinem nostrae quo{que} naturae ortus &amp; occasus: una est omnibus via, unus ingressus vitae circulus,</hi> There is of our nature a rising, and a going downe, as of the Sunne: there is one way to all, wee all walke one circle of life. But as I conceive, this ariseth not to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the place. For as in the Verse before the Preacher comparing man with the earth, shewed the vanity of man to be greater than the earth is subject to: So in these following verses he compareth the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of man with the Sunne, and wind, and waters, shewing it to bee greater, than that which they have in them. This verse speaketh of the Sunne,<note place="margin">Zanchius de operibus Dei.</note> which though a glorious creature, and as <hi>Zanchius</hi> speaketh, <hi>Gloriosior quod alios illuminet, quam quod ipse luceat,</hi> more glorious that it illightneth others, then that it is so bright in it selfe, yet much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour is it unto mans beauty and glory. Notwithstanding the Preacher shewing the transitory vanity of man, preferreth the Sunne before it: which though in motion it passeth on from rising to going downe, yet passeth not away, but returneth to his place, as <hi>Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Theodotio</hi> did translate the word: or <gap reason="foreign">

Our English saith, hasteth, the French very well, <hi>ahane,</hi> laboureth hard towards his place, as one that bloweth labouring:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177008:9"/> and which though labouring, yet laboureth not in vaine, but commeth to his place. <hi>Man passeth away, and his place beholdeth him no more,</hi>

                        <hi>Iob</hi> 20.9.</note> as <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar</hi> speaketh in <hi>Iob:</hi> but the Sunne commeth to his place, that is, to the poynt where his circular motion is terminated and accomplished: for as the place of any thing is, that wherein it stayeth; so that is sayd to be the place of the Sunne, because there it stayeth from going to any other poynt, wherein it hath not been before. The Sunne commeth to his place <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>&amp; oritur ipse ibi,</hi> and it selfe ariseth there, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> rightly translateth the Hebrew; whereas man passeth away, and another ariseth in his place. Now this being the proper translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Originall words, doth much confirme that to be the meaning of the verse which I have delivered. Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> as also St. <hi>Hierome</hi> applying this verse in a mystery to <hi>Christ,</hi> shew how that he is the Sunne, <hi>Qui oritur justis, &amp; occidit injustis,</hi> which riseth to the righteous, and shineth upon them, but goeth downe to the unrighteous, and leaveth them in darknesse: but then they doe also both of them reade the next words thus, <hi>Trahit ad locum suum,</hi> draweth to his place,<note place="margin">Ambros. in Psal. <hi>119.</hi> Octon. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> and applying it to <hi>Christ,</hi> say, that he being gone to heaven, doth draw the desires of all men unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 6. The Septuagint doe make the first part of this verse to belong to the former verse, as if the Preacher spake it of the Sunne, That he goeth to the South, and returneth about to the North: and thereupon Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> applying it mystically to <hi>Christ,</hi> sayth that he went first to the South, first to the <hi>Iewes, Ad nobiliorem plebem, quae erat genus electum, vendicans sibi Patriarcharum prosapiam,</hi> The more noble people, which was a chosen Nation, challenging to themselves their descent from the Patriarchs: but because these persisted in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, he returned about to the North, <hi>Gyravit ad Gentes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. in Psal. <hi>119.</hi> Octon. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> He came about to the Gentiles. But to take the words as a part of this verse, and as applyed to the winde, for so the Originall doth apply them. Wee have here the vanitie of man compared to <hi>the winde:</hi> and though that may be conceived to be of all things most vaine, most light; yet here mans vanitie is shewed to be greater. And whereas <hi>Iob</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 7.7.</note>
                     <hi>O remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that my life is winde;</hi> the Preacher sayth, that it is more vaine then winde. For though the winde passe on speedily, and passe away quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though most inconstantly it passe from place to place, and every way turneth it selfe, which our Translation hath, <hi>whirleth about continually,</hi> yet it returneth still, and going from the North, it commeth backe to the North againe: but it is not so with man: and that which <hi>Iob</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of himselfe, is true of every man, <hi>When a few yeares are come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>I shall goe the way whence I shall not returne.</hi> That this is the meaning of the verse, the Originall sheweth by the conclusion of it, where it is sayd, <hi>Vadi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ventus &amp; revertitur super circulos suos,</hi> the winde goeth and returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine upon his circles, <hi>Atque in se sua per vestigia volvitur,</hi> and is turned into it selfe, by its owne steps, as the Poet speaketh: as if the Preacher did bid us to note, that although the winde goeth toward the South,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177008:10"/> and returneth unto the North, that though it turne never so many wayes whirling continually, yet that the going of it hath his returnes in the circles of it: whereas the passing breath of mans life hath no returne. But though man being gone from his naturall life cannot returne, yet being gone from his spirituall life, he may and should returne. In this it were good, if man were like the winde, and being gone to the South of sinfull lusts and pleasures, to the South of vaine and worldly content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it were good that he would returne to the North of sorrow and repentance for his sinnes, for his vanities; and having wandred here and there, and whirled about continually in the giddy mazes of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, it were good that he would returne according to his circuits, and goe backe to God by the contrary courses of amendment. This is that which God calleth for so earnestly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cantic.</hi> 6.13.</note> saying, <hi>Returne, returne O Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamite, returne, returne.</hi> Where the word <hi>returne</hi> being foure times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> sayth, that wee are called to returne from foure things,<note place="margin">Bern.

For these being the vanities of the world, from these wee must returne, to goe to God, to come to happinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 7. Here the vanitie of man is compared to <hi>the Rivers,</hi> which though they goe away likewise, yet it is but into <hi>the Sea:</hi> from whence as they come forth, so thither their returne is, that from thence they may come forth againe. And therefore as one speaketh, <hi>Dum mare sine intermissione recipit quod effudit, sine defectu effundit quod recipit, &amp; fit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus sine defectu,</hi> while the Sea without ceasing receiveth that which it sendeth forth, it sendeth forth without ceasing that which it receiveth, and so the passing away of the Rivers is not a passing away. But the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing away of men is into the bottomlesse gulph of death, from whence is no issuing forth: that devoureth all, sendeth backe none, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the vanitie of men to be worse then of the Rivers. And that this is the meaning, appeareth from the words. For when it is sayd, <hi>All the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers run into the Sea, yet the Sea is not full,</hi> why is this added, but to shew that the end why the Rivers goe into the Sea, is not to fill it, seeing that is not filled, that is, is not filled the more by them. But what then is the end why the Rivers goe into the Sea? The Originall plainly sheweth, and as it is rightly translated by the Septuagint, and by the Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine it cleerely appeareth. For say they, <hi>Ad locum unde exeunt flumina, revertuntur, ut iterum fluant,</hi> the Rivers returne to the place from whence they came, that they may flow againe. Wherefore in their flowing againe, they are not so vaine as man, who in his flowing away hath no reflux allowed him. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> in a morall sense applyeth this verse unto Preachers, who having studied and meditated of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, doe then send them forth, for the watering of the Lords fields;<note place="margin">Greg. Mor. l. <hi>30.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> and when they have done so, doe then returne to studying and meditating againe. Because unlesse they doe this, <hi>Interna caecitas etiam
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177008:10"/> externa praedicationis verba siccabit,</hi> An inward ignorance, will dry up the outward words of their preaching. But by this meanes, <hi>Quasi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursura foras flumina intus semper oriuntur, quatenus illic amando sumunt, unde ad nos praedicando defluunt,</hi> the rivers which flow forth abroad, doe arise within continually, for as much as from them they take by a studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous love, those things which by preaching flow forth to us. Or else in a morall sense, we may apply the verse another way.<note place="margin">Caesarius, Dialog. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> And as <hi>Caesarius</hi> the brother of <hi>Nazianzene</hi> saith, <hi>Pulchrum quo{que} quod quum mare flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum sit mater, ipsum eadem rursus suscipit; hinc quidem quasi inlucem proferens, illinc vero recipiens quasi hospites,</hi> This also is delightfull, that whereas the Sea is the mother of the rivers, it selfe doth receive the same againe: now bringing them forth as it were into the light, then receaving them, as it were guests unto her. So may we admire the Sea of Gods goodnesse, who by his Holy Spirit having brought forth the children of grace, when by their holy obedience they doe returne unto him, doth entertaine them as welcome guests with all respects of love. Now as all this ought to humble us; so it must stirre us up to the seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a better life, seeing in this life so many of the creatures doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell us.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 8. The verse saith, <hi>All things are full of labour,</hi> and it is not an easie thing, it is not a little labour to find the meaning of the verse. Howsoever the ancient expositours may have satisfied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the understanding of it, that which they say doth not satisfie me. The Originall may be translated, either <hi>Omnes res</hi> all things, and so doe the septuagint and the vulgar latine read it, or else <hi>omnes sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> all words, and so doe <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reade it. In that which followeth, the Originall saith no more then this, <hi>Non potest homo eloqui,</hi> man cannot expresse. Our English applyeth it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to labour, saying, <hi>Man cannot utter it.</hi> The Ancients apply it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the things, or to the words, saying, Man cannot expresse them. As for the meaning of the Verse, the Ancients understood it of the knowledge of things, which it is laborious and difficult for man to get: and seeing man doth not know what things are, much lesse can hee expresse what they are. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, man cannot by his owne study, find the knowledge of things: the eare is not filled with hearing, man cannot learne the knowledge of things by the hearing of others.<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> Wherefore Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith that it is written <hi>Contra eos qui putant otiosis sibi &amp; vota facientibus, venire noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam scripturarum,</hi> Who thinke that the knowledge of the Scriptures
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177008:11"/> will come unto them,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sancto Vict. Homil. <hi>1.</hi> in Ecclesiast.</note> being idle and wishing for it only: <hi>Hugo de San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto Victore</hi> understandeth the latter part of the verse thus, That although man doth not attaine to the knowledge of things, yet that which hee attaineth unto, doth give him that sweet delight, that hee still seeketh more, and that the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the eare filled with hearing. Wherefore hee saith, <hi>Cor humanum toti mundo non suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit: &amp; totus mundus cordi humano non sufficit,</hi> The heart of man is not sufficient for the whole world, and the whole world is not sufficient for the heart of man. The first he sheweth, because all things are hard to be understood, and man cannot expresse what they are: The second, because the eye is not satisfied, nor the eare filled with seeing and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> expounding the verse as being translated, <hi>Omnes sermones sunt laboriosi, All words are full of labour, man cannot utter them,</hi> tells us, that nothing is more easie then to speake, and therefore that we must understand the Preacher of those words, whereof the Apostle speaking saith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.</note> That they are worthy of double honour who labour in the word. <hi>Sermones ergo sunt qui verè sunt sermones, qui fiunt ad ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum utilitatem.</hi> The words therefore (saith he) are those, which are truly words, and which are spoken to the profit of soules. And such words (saith he) are full of labour, because they who teach them must be carefull to follow them in their owne lives. But if a man cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse those words, how can he utter that Aeternall word of God? The Father addeth truely,<note place="margin">Gregor.

But to deliver mine apprehension of the meaning of the verse: I conceive the Preacher to say, That all things desired by man are full of labour, full of wearinesse in the seeking of them, which is a misery unto him: and that the misery is made the greater, for as much as the desire of man is not full, not wearied in the seeking of them. For as one well speaketh, <hi>Magna est miseria semper ad indigentiam accipere, &amp; nunquam indigentiâ accipiendi posse carere,</hi> It is a great misery, alwayes to receive for the supplying of our want, and never to want the need of receiving. And yet this is the vaine condition of man in this world. So that as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Ambros. de Bono mortis c. <hi>7.</hi>

Or else, I take the meaning of the Preacher thus: That all things being full of wearinesse even when they are enjoyed, yet that man is not weary in the desiring of them. And the things desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or enjoyed by man belonging either to the body or to the soule, the unsatisfied desire of things belonging to the body, is expressed by <hi>the eye,</hi> of things belonging to the soule is expressed by <hi>the eare.</hi>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 9. Man, whose fickle changeablenesse cannot fasten upon the permanency of any thing, doth seeke to settle his contentment in the newnesse of things. But this also the Preacher declareth to be vaine, shewing here that there is nothing new, neither that which shall bee, nor that which is, because <hi>that which shall be, hath beene, that which is, shall be.</hi> The kind of things is still the same, the contentment which they yeeld is still the same in the nature of it, the vanity of the things, and of the delight taken in them is still the same, for <hi>there is nothing new under the Sunne.</hi> If we will have new things, we must goe above the Sunne. There indeed are new things of another nature, things of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, things of true contentment, things in which there is no vanity. But that we may attaine to these, we must be new creatures by amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our life: the old man must be crucified in us, that we may be glorified in these new things. The Septuagint, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and the Vulgar Latin, doe read this verse by way of question and answer, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Quid est quod fuit? Ipsum quod futurum est. Quid est quod factum est? Ipsum quod faciendum est,</hi> What is that which hath beene? The very same which shall be. What is that which hath beene done? The very same which shall bee done. And surely in naturall things it is a thing most evident, a certaine course and constant order being still ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in them. As for civill affaires, which are swayed and caryed by the will of man, he that shall duely marke them, even in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test variety and inconstancy thereof, shall find a revolution, whereby they are turned about in one and the same circle. Wherefore hence it is that the knowledge of Histories is accounted so excellent, because setting things past before our eyes, it shewes us how to order the things
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:177008:12"/> that are present. So that they who are taken up with novelty and stand so much amazed at it, doe thereby but give the greater testimony of their great ignorance in things that are past, being indeed like children or rude Country people, by whom many things are received and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired as new and strange, which in the City and Court, are common, stale, and of no regard. But seeing there <hi>is nothing new,</hi> let this bridle our restlesse desire in seeking after new things, let us fasten our minds with this nayle, and make them contented with things that are present, least skipping hither and thither, now after one thing, then another, we take away quietnesse which is the only solace of our life. <hi>Gregory Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sene</hi> having here a peculiar exposition of this passage, let me have leave to set it downe. He reading the verse by way of a question, supposeth that the Preacher having shewed all things, that are, to be vaine, doth here aske the question, What is to be conceived of those things which have been? And that answering he telleth us, that as things shall be, so they were, that is, as they shall be renued to a perfection in the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, so they were made in perfection in the creation. And then we may take the following words to signifie: but that as yet <hi>there is nothing under the Sunne</hi> renued from the vanitie thereof. There must be a new heaven,<note place="margin">Gregor. Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast. Homil. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> and a new earth, when that shall be. The same Father obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the difference of phrase that is used, in, <hi>Hath been,</hi> and <hi>Hath been done,</hi> applyeth the one to the soule, the other to the body. For (sayth he) <hi>Fuit seu orta est anima, &amp; corpus factum est,</hi> The soule was or began to be; but the body was made. The soule therefore which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne, shall be purged, and shall be so againe: the body as it was first made, so shall it be made againe. <hi>Neque enim est aliquid aliud resurrectio nisi quae sit omnino in pristinum statum restitutio,</hi> for (sayth he) the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is nothing else but a restitution into the former state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 10. This verse is added, to expresse more fully, more force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the sense of the former: and because worldly mindes imagine to themselves, a newnesse, a varietie of some things, wherewith their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is much taken; the Preacher therefore sayth, whatsoever any one may imagine to himselfe, or others may admire; <hi>Is there any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it may be truely sayd, See this is new?</hi> Or seeing the Originall goes thus, <hi>Estne verbum, quod dicat?</hi> Is there a word which may say? Wee may take it thus. Is there any new word to be invented, that may set forth any new thing? The answer of the common saying is, <hi>Nihil jam dictum, quod non sit dictum prius,</hi> there is nothing now sayd, which was not sayd before. And the answer of the Preacher is, that all things are so farre from being new, that they are old, and have been already of old time. But because the former verse may also have another meaning, that will give another sense unto this. When it is sayd therefore, <hi>The thing which hath been, it is that which shall be,</hi> wee may conceive the meaning to be, That as that which hath been, is not now, so that which shall be, is not yet, and so both doe shew their vanitie in their not being. When it is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:177008:12"/> sayd, <hi>That which is done, is that which shall be done,</hi> we may take the sense to be, that also the thing which is, is much what the same with that which shall be, because it is so little time untill that it shall not be, and so even no lesse vaine. Wherefore an ancient writer sayth, <hi>Quod est, dum est, pene nihil est,</hi> that which is, while it is, is almost nothing, seeing the moments of the present time doe flie away so fast. And when the Preacher addeth, <hi>Nihil est novum sub sole,</hi> Nothing is new under the Sunne, <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> expoundeth it,<note place="margin">Gregor. Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast. Homil. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> That which is new under the Sunne, is nothing indeed. Now if thus we take the meaning of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verse: then the force, which this verse addeth to it, is this, That so vaine is the continuance of the thing, that is, that it doth not stay, untill it can be sayd, It is. And if it be asked, what it is? He that answereth must tell, what it was, not what it is. And when it is added, <hi>It hath been already of old time, which was before:</hi> in a consequent exposition, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that must be, that nothing is truely sayd to be but God onely, who hath been of old even from everlasting, and before that wee ever were. For seeing <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> expoundeth <hi>novum esse</hi> to be new, by <hi>revera subsistere,</hi> to be and to subsist indeed, and thereupon understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing to be new, because nothing in this world truely is; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in like manner that which is sayd to be of old, must be understood of that which truely is, and that is God alone. But to apply this in a morall sense: it serveth well to teach patience unto Gods servants, and if they be hated of the world, it is that which hath been alwayes in the world; if they suffer reproach, slanders, persecution, it is that which shall be done to Gods servants after themselves be gone. <hi>The thing which hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done, it is that which shall be done.</hi> Neither let any say it is strange, it is new that which I endure. For <hi>is there any thing of which it may be sayd, see this is new?</hi> No,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.16.</note> the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God have of old endured the same, whatsoever it be that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by any: and therefore let every one expect that to be done to himselfe, which hath been done to them. In the vision of the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> wee reade of a wheele in the wheele,<note place="margin">Ambros. de Virg. l. <hi>3.</hi> circa finem.</note> and this Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> expoundeth to be, <hi>Vitam intra vitam, quod Sanctorum vita sibi non disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, sed qualis fuerit superioris aetatis, talis sit &amp; sequentis,</hi> Life within life, because the life of Gods Saints is not different the one from the other, but such as it was in the former ages, such it is in the ages that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 11. It is some kinde of preservation of things that are not, that they are not forgotten: and because this might seeme to mitigate the vanitie of worldly things, the Preacher sheweth that there is also <hi>no remembrance</hi> of things, neither <hi>of former things</hi> which goe before, that is, neither of things past which are already gone, neither of things present when they shall be gone also, neither shall there be any remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of things which shall be, whether they shall be soone after,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. Homil. <hi>2.</hi> in Ecclesiast.</note> or whether a long time after. So that as <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> speaketh; <hi>Non solum praesentia eorum interitu sublata est, sed memoria quo{que} oblivione
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:177008:13"/> deleta est,</hi> not onely their presence by perishing is taken away, but their memory also by oblivion is blotted out. Wherefore let this check the great minds of some, who thinke to doe some great thing by which they will be remembred, and let it make them to seeke after righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.7.</note> for it is the righteous, it is the memory of the righteous that is blessed. Or else let me offer to consideration, this meaning of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher: who to shew the vanitie of worldly things, sayth, that there is no remembrance <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>capitum &amp; primariorum,</hi> of those who have been chiefe and highest in worldly esteeme, of those who by their famous deeds, their glorious works, have striven to leave their memory behind them: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and much more that there is no remembrance of them, who have been inferiour in the worlds repute: and that they who shall be, whether great ones or of meaner accompt, shall not be remembred by them who follow after them. <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> taking here also the same way in expounding this verse, that he did in expounding the former, goes from the beginning to the end of the world, and conceiveth the Preachers meaning to be, That as now there is no memory of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse wherein man was created; so in the Resurrection, there shall be no remembrance of the misery which man now suffereth.<note place="margin">Gregor.

                     </note>
                     <hi>Hildebertus</hi> considering the same of all worldly things, sayth of them; <hi>Haec aliena esse fuga ipsorum denuntiat. Bona vaga, bona pennata sunt haec omnia. Eorum est, nusquam es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se diutius, eorum status nemini statum praefigere certiorem,</hi> That these things doe not properly belong unto us, their flying away from us doth plainly declare. Gadding good things, winged good things are all these things. It is their propertie to be no where long, it is their condition to afford unto none a certaine condition. <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting also that he sayth, <hi>I was King,</hi> giveth it this touch; <hi>Fui inquit, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si dicat, jam non sum, quia etsi sum, id ipsum jam nihil esse agnosco quod sum;</hi> He sayth, I was, as if he had sayd, I am not now; because although I am, yet I know that to be nothing which now I am. Or else if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this booke to have been written by <hi>Solomon</hi> after his repentance, wee may conceive him to say, <hi>I was King,</hi> as one that was come downe from his throne of glory, and lying on the ground, lamenting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing his former iniquities and vanities. But one sayth very well; <hi>Vtinam tam certum de poenitentia illius, quam non dubium de culpa testimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um haberemus,</hi> I would to God that the proofe of his repentance were as certaine, as that of his fault is undoubted. Or lastly, in that he sayth, <hi>I was,</hi> wee may note him to have been King a long time when that he wrote this Booke, and so to have written it in his old age. <hi>King over Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in Ierusalem:</hi> and being so, he wanted neither wealth nor power
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:177008:14"/> to get knowledge, both the more fully and the more easily. Which therefore shameth those which being great and rich, yet are illiterate and idiots in knowledge. And surely it is a great damage both to Church and State, that they are the poorer sort onely who seeke after knowledge, and who being destitute of meanes, cannot make so happy progresse in it. But these also are too often worthy of blame. For when by some degree of knowledge they have attained greatnesse and wealth, and so are made fit to seeke more, then doe they lay aside their seeking, as refusing to fight when they are well armed, and then one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being forward to the battell, when they are naked and without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons. A Greeke Father applyeth the verse to <hi>Christ,</hi> telling us, that as he is called the Physitian, the life, the resurrection, the light, the way, the dore, the truth, so here the Preacher, <hi>Omnia nomina humanitatis &amp; bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volentiae in homines,</hi> all being names of his love and good will towards men. Wherefore he addeth, <hi>Nos alloquitur Ecclesiastes: audiam us ejus verba, qui sumus ecclesia,</hi> The head of the Church speaketh unto us: let us heare him, who are the Church.</p>

The matter is <hi>all things that are done under heaven,</hi> as the Ethicks of the manners of men, the civill histories of the deeds of men, the naturall history of the works of God.

The method of his study we have, in that it is sayd, <hi>by wisedome,</hi> for that is the onely right method of well seeking any thing. And therefore an ancient Writer maketh him to say, <hi>Si sine sapientia quaererem, etiamsi sapientiam quaererem, insipienter quaererem,</hi> If I sought without wisedome, although I sought wisedome, I should unwisely seeke. Method is the wise part of study, but an unwise method, is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall folly. The manner of his studying wee have in that <hi>he sought and searched. Quaerebat ignota, investigabat profunda,</hi> he sought things unknowne, he searched deepe things, sayth <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore.</hi> Or else we may understand his seeking, of seeking the helpe, counsell, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of others, for that the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">

For both must goe together to make a good Student: seeking to see what others have found, searching to try what himselfe can finde. The diligence of his studying we have in that he gave his heart unto it; he went about it, not onely with a willingnesse, but with a love, which lockt him up, and held him hard unto it.

And surely this glory will be the greater unto them, who studying the knowledge of the creatures, and those many miracles which are shewed in them, doe thereby set forth the glory of the Creatour.

S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, that his Hebrew Master taught him to take it <hi>pro afflictione spiritus,</hi> for the affliction of the spirit.

And this being the most proper significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the radicall word, doth also exceeding well agree unto the place.

                     <hi>Non esurientes animas, sed esuriem ipsam pascunt animarum,</hi> They doe not feed our hungry soules, but rather the hunger of our soules.

                     <hi>Et facilius quod praemittit, vanum esse agnoscitur, dum id quod infert durum esse sentitur,</hi> And that which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth is the more easily acknowledged to be vaine, by how much that which it bringeth is found to be grievous, as <hi>Hugo</hi> speaketh.

                     <hi>Quomodo difficilè expertus sum meliores, quam qui monasteriis profecerunt, ita non sum exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus pejores quam qui in monasteriis ceciderunt,</hi> As I have hardly found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better then they who have profited in monasteries; so I have found none to be worse, then they who have fallen in monasteries. For such are hardly amended. But as for fooles, as for those who were never good, the number of them is infinite. It is a small matter,<note place="margin">Cajetanus.</note> which <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> lamenteth, as standing amazed at the miserable condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, because of ten Virgins, the one halfe even five were foolish: it is rather to be wondred at, that all are not foolish, seeing so many are.

But to consider the words, as in themselves they offer themselves. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> doe reade the first part of the verse thus, <hi>Perversum non potest adornari,</hi> that which is perverse cannot be adorned; and thereupon S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> sayth, <hi>Qui per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus nisi ante corrigatur, non potest adornari. Recta ornatum reciptunt, &amp; curva correctionem,</hi> He that is perverse, unlesse he be first corrected, cannot be adorned. Right things doe receive adorning, and crooked things correction. Our English sayth, <hi>that which is crooked cannot be made straight:</hi> or else it may be read thus; that which is out of order cannot be ordered, <hi>and that which is wanting cannot be numbred.</hi> And for the meaning of it, the Preacher having sayd, that all things that are done <hi>are vanitie and vexation of spirit,</hi> here he sheweth the vanitie of them, in that they are <hi>crooked,</hi> perverse, and out of order: the vexation of spirit that they bring, in that their crookednesse cannot be corrected. <hi>The vanitie</hi> he sheweth in the defects of them; <hi>the vexation of spirit</hi> that they bring, in that their defects cannot be supplyed. For not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, is, not to be, because of nothing there is no number, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

First, that they <hi>are crooked</hi> and out of order, and so crooked, so out of order that they cannot be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>and made straight.</hi> Secondly, that they are full of defects, and that the defects are so great, as not having so much entitie or being in them, as that they can <hi>be numbred:</hi> for the least thing that is admitteth nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 16. <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore,</hi> who still taketh <hi>Solomon</hi> in the worst sense, supposeth him to speake this of his former pride of life. And thereupon when the Preacher sayth, <hi>In corde dixi,</hi> I sayd in mine heart, he addeth, <hi>In corde dixi, de corde enim tumui,</hi> I sayd in mine heart, for I swelled in mine heart. And then shewing how a proud heart doth still swell bigger, he noteth, that he, <hi>Qui primum de se plus quam debuit, sensit; deinde usque ad aliorum contemptum venit,</hi> who first thought of himselfe more than he ought, next proceeded even to a contempt of others, saying, <hi>that he had gotten more wisedome, then all that were before him in Ierusalem:</hi> So that he made himselfe <hi>praecedentibus summum, subsequentibus primum,</hi> the highest to them that went before him, the first to them that followed after him. But not to thinke so ill of what <hi>Solomon</hi> spake: if we looke with a milder eye upon him, wee may behold his humilitie here. For first he did speake <hi>in his owne heart</hi> of his great estate, he did not with great words set it out to others.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:177008:16"/> His heart sayd it, that his heart might give thankes to God, who had made him so great. Secondly, whereas God had sayd of him that he should be wiser then any that were before him,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 3.12.</note> or any that should be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, he speaketh onely of those <hi>that were in Ierusalem before him;</hi> so that he doth not preferre himselfe before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moyses,</hi> and others that were not in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Yea, whereas the Originall is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>ad facies meas,</hi> before me in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as present there with me, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that he may be understood, onely to preferre himselfe before them, which either himselfe had sent for to commune with; or which had come of themselves to try him and his wisedome; as the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> did. But to consider the meaning of the verse, as it standeth in the Chapter. Either we may take it thus, that <hi>Solomon</hi> from the vanitie of other things reflecting upon himselfe, and saying in his own heart, What shall I say of my selfe? <hi>I am become great,</hi> though other things be small and vaine; and though the wisedome of others before me were vaine, <hi>I have gotten more wisedome then all that were before me:</hi> yea, not onely is it more then others have gotten, but much also in it selfe, much wisedome, much knowledge. <hi>My heart hath seene much,</hi> sayth the Originall, and S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> sayth upon it,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> that the eye of his heart had seene more, then his tongue was able to utter. Or else wee may take the meaning thus: that <hi>Solomon</hi> being ashamed in himselfe of the vanitie which he saw in worldly things, He communed with his owne heart, saying, <hi>I am come to great estate,</hi> I am a great King, I have meanes to doe things in a better manner, shall those things which are done by me be vaine also? And that thereupon he sayth, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>adjeci</hi> I added, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ierome</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> doe reade it, I added to my great estate, great wisedome by study and paines, even greater then all they that have been before me in <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> yea my heart looked into the depth of wisedome, and knowledge.

                     </note> that first it is sayd wisedome, then knowledge, <hi>Quoniam in multitudine sapientiae est multitudo cognitionis,</hi> because in the greatnesse of wisedome, is the greatnesse of knowledge.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. In this verse <hi>Hugo</hi> supposeth <hi>Solomon</hi> to set forth also his own former vanity. And therfore when he saith, <hi>I gave mine heart to know,</hi> he noteth him, to shew the pride of his heart, as if for him to know wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it were enough but to give his mind to know it. And when he saith, that he sought to know madnesse and folly, he expoundeth it. <hi>Nequaqua ad hoc mala cognoscere voluit, ut cognita vitaret,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. in Ecclesiast. Homil. <hi>7.</hi>

                     <hi>sed ut se de malorum cogniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one extolleret, &amp; alios de opere damnaret,</hi> that his will to know those evils was not at all, that he might shunne them being knowne, but that he might boast himselfe of the knowledge of the evils, and might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne others for the doing of them. And lastly, when he saith, <hi>I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that this also is vexation of spirit:</hi> he apprehendeth the affliction
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:177008:17"/> of labour to have quelled the pride of his spirit, as before it did the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity of his spirit: and that his vexation was, because his knowledge, <hi>Iniquum per conscientiam arguebat, quam elatus ad ostentationem quaerebat,</hi> did prove him in his conscience to bee wicked, seeing in his pride hee sought it for ostentation. But to consider <hi>Solomon</hi> in a better minde. This verse sheweth, that having gotten more wisedome then others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, yet he did not cease to get still more, but <hi>giving his heart to it,</hi> he still laboured to know wisdome. And that he might the better know it, he laboured not only to know it in it selfe, but to know it also by comparing it with <hi>madnesse and folly,</hi> that the foulnesse of the one might set out the beauty and clearenesse of the other. And first hee sought to know wisdome, that knowing madnesse and folly, he might as well hate them, as know them. The Originall word is plurall, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of <hi>madnesses,</hi> as shewing the many kinds which are of <hi>madnesse.</hi> And because <hi>madnesse</hi> commonly is joyned with a conceit of wisdome, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>folly</hi> to expresse it truly. But whatsoever he was in greatnesse, or how great soever the wisedome was which he had gotten, or how great paines soever he tooke to get wisdome, in conclusion, <hi>it was vexation of spirit</hi> to him, to know, that himselfe also was vanity, that his wisdome was no better, and that he could not by all his wisedome redresse the vanity of those things which he did. In conclusion, by his wisedome and knowledge he perceaved and came to know, that even <hi>this was vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of spirit.</hi> The Originall word is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> and by Pagnine according to the Chaldee signification of the word is translated <hi>cogitatio spiritus,</hi> a thought of the spirit: which well agreeth to the place. For <hi>Solomon</hi> having communed in his heart, and thought with himselfe of this and that, he knew it at last to be but a vaine thought of his heart: having brought himselfe to this perfection of knowledge, as to know himselfe and his wisdome to be as the vanity of a thought.<note place="margin">Bernard in Serm. de <hi>7.</hi> donis Spir.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:177008:17"/> knowledge causeth delight, but in respect of the things knowne, that it causeth sorrow. Now if they bee good things which are knowne, then the sorrow is from the great labour, which a man must take to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the knowledge of them; and from the little perfection of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to which his great paines hath brought him. If they bee evill things which are knowne, then his sorrow is, that he is subject to them. Thus Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> understandeth the latter part of the verse, saying,<note place="margin">Ambros. de spiritu &amp; Anima.</note>
                     <hi>Qui apponit scientiam; apponit dolorem; quia quanto magis homo sua mala intelligit, tanto amplius suspirat &amp; gemit,</hi> He that addeth knowledge, addeth griefe; because by how much the more a man knoweth his evils, by so much the more hee lamenteth and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And to the same purpose Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> expoundeth it, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Qui apponit scientiam, apponit dolorem;</hi>

But as for the former part of the verse, that which our translation readeth griefe, in the originall is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which signifieth <hi>indignation,</hi> according as by the Septuagint it is translated, and as the vulgar Latine readeth it. Now as it is so read, the sense of it is well given by Saint <hi>Hierome, Quanto magis quis sapientiam fuerit conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutus, tanto plus indignatur subjacere vitiis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc versum.</note>
                     <hi>&amp; procul esse a virtutibus quas requirit;</hi> By how much the more any one hath obtained wisedome, by so much the greater is his indignation, that he is subject to vices, and is so farre from vertues which he seeketh after. And this is that indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</note> that the sorrow of repentance had caused in the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> joy. And therefore <hi>Salonius</hi> also saith, <hi>Quanto quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que plus proficit in sapientia, tanto magis sibi irascitur de malis operibus quae gessit,</hi> By how much the more any one profiteth in wisdome,<note place="margin">Salonius.</note> by so much the more is he angry with himselfe for the evill workes which he hath done. But the indignation which is here spoken of, the <hi>Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrast</hi> understandeth not to be the indignation of man,<note place="margin">Chald.

                  <p>Now against this which <hi>Solomon</hi> here teacheth, perhaps it will be objected, that some there are, who spend their whole time, and even grow old in the study of Philosophy, History and other lesse usefull matters, and therefore that they seeme to find great delight in it, seeing they cannot be drawne from it. But the reason of this is, not that they have attained to more than <hi>Solomon</hi> did, but that with <hi>Solomon</hi> they doe not take an account of their study, to see what the true benefit of their paines and study is, whereby they would soone perceive the small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 2. The Originall most directly maketh the Preacher to speake to laughter, to mirth, not of laughter, of mirth, as shewing that even in laughter, in mirth, he had that care of himselfe, as that even then he was able to condemne it, able to reproove it. Now by <hi>laughter,</hi> wee may understand an excessive mirth, because it is commonly an excessive mirth that breaketh forth into laughter: by <hi>mirth,</hi> we may understand a lesser violent degree of worldly delight. Or else by <hi>laughter,</hi> we may understand an outward delight, because that joy which lyeth hid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by laughter, <hi>Ruptis quasi modestiae claustris,</hi>

By <hi>mirth,</hi> wee may understand, an inward and secret delight, which sometimes is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the secrecy of it. Or else we may understand the Preacher to mention <hi>laughter,</hi> thereby to shew that he speaketh of a carnall mirth. For a spirituall mirth, doth seldome or never dissolve the minde into laughter. <hi>Sed ea tantum laetitia quae a carnis blandimento concipitur, etiam per carnis motum facile aperitur,</hi> but onely that mirth which is conceived by a flattering of the flesh, is also manifested easily by the motion of the flesh, as <hi>Hugo</hi> also hath it.

Of <hi>mirth,</hi> that which the Preacher sayth, is onely a question, <hi>What doth it?</hi> As shewing that himselfe could not tell of any good that it doth. Or else it may be taken as implying, What doth it but cause that mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of laughter whereof I have spoken? Or else it may be taken as a challenge to all the most cunning inventers of pleasure, to tell if they can,<note place="margin">Chald. Para.</note> what true good it doth? The exposition which the Chaldee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth of it, is this, <hi>Quid emolumenti est viro qui fecerit illud,</hi> What benefit is it to a man who hath been taken with it? And if you will know the answer which a Greeke Father giveth, he will tell you, what it doth, saying, <hi>Naturae virtutem effoeminat, animi robur emollit, animae vires ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat, affert interitum rationi, cogitationum serenarum puritati caliginis tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bras immittit;</hi> It effeminateth the vertue of nature, it enfeebleth the strength of the minde, it weakneth the forces of the soule, it bringeth destruction to reason, it casteth the mist of darknesse upon the puritie of serene thoughts. The same Father apprehendeth the Preacher to speake here of or to mirth as to a thiefe unawares crept into the house of his soule, and thereupon to say unto it, <hi>What dost thou?</hi> What dost thou here thou pernicious enemy, and doing me little or no good, whatsoever contentment for the present thou pretendest to bring unto me? Lastly, an ancient Writer noteth here, <hi>Quod gaudium tantum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guitur, risus vero omnino reprobatur: quia risus omnimodo malus est, gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um verò non semper malum est, nisi quando de malo est,</hi> That mirth is here onely reprooved, but that laughter is altogether rejected: because that laughter is wholly evill, mirth is not alwayes evill, unlesse it be in an evill thing.

According whereunto the French trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation doth also render it. <hi>I' ai recherche en mon caeur le moyen de me traitter delicatement,</hi> I sought in mine heart the meanes to use my selfe delicately. <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> doth reade it,<note place="margin">Greg. Nyss. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Consideravi an cor meum car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem meam tanquam vinum traheret, &amp; cor meum deduxit me in sapientia,</hi> I considered whether my heart could draw my flesh as it were wine, and my heart lead me in wisedome: which he expoundeth thus; As the thirst of a man draweth the wine easily and earnestly unto it, so I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered how my heart, how mine understanding might easily draw the sensitive parts of my soule after it, and make them readily to be ruled by it: which being done, I went on without any hindrance in the way of wisedome. As our translation doth render it, so we may note, that the folly of following wine, and the voluptuousnesse of feeding and feasting thereby noted, was so apparant without tryall, that it was not enough for him to say, <hi>I thought to give my selfe to wine,</hi> but <hi>I sought in my heart to doe it,</hi> it was a labour to him to bring his heart unto so foolish a thing. Or else we may conceive the labour to be, because he would both give himselfe to wine and belly delight, and also <hi>acquaint his heart with wisedome,</hi> which must needs be very hard, seeing that so quickly destroyeth the wisedome of any one. But therefore it followeth, <hi>that he would lay hold on folly,</hi> he would not suffer that to lay hold on him; because then he should not be able to cast it off so readily, as having it in his owne power he might doe. And if I might presume to deliver mine apprehension, I would render it thus: <hi>I sought in my heart to bend eagerly my sensuall appetite unto the drinking of wine, and I sought also to draw my heart unto it, which leading me in wisedome was averse from it, and that I might make it to take hold on folly.</hi> For though the Originall word signifie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:177008:20"/> to draw, yet I render it to bend, the drawing of the appetite being like the drawing of a bow, which the more strongly it is drawne, the more it is bent. In the rendring of the latter part of the verse, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the end for which he did the other, all doe agree. And because it speaketh <hi>of the good whieh men should doe all the dayes of their life:</hi> a Greeke Father noteth, that some things seeme good to men, but it is only for a short time, there being speedily a wearinesse of them: and that there are some things which are good to men in their youth, other things that are good to them in their old age; but that the Preacher would see that good thing, <hi>Cujus cum participatione extenditur appetitus, &amp; ejus aetate qui desiderat non circumscribitur,</hi> the desire whereof is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the enjoying of it, and which is not limited by his age, by whom it is desired. But the Originall goes thus, <hi>Numero dierum vitae eorum,</hi> in the number of the dayes of their life, as shewing the fewnesse of mans dayes, so that they may be numbred. For as the Poet speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Pauperis est numerare pecus,</hi> It is a signe of a poore man to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Cattle, so it is a proofe of the scantnesse of mans dayes, that number doth easily measure them.</p>

And let any one be never so little, <hi>Magnus est qui aeterna concupiscit,</hi> He is indeed great, that seeketh heavenly things. And to the same purpose <hi>Seneca</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> speakes worthily, <hi>Nihil magnum in rebus humanis, nisi cor magna despici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> There is nothing great in humane things, but a heart despising the things esteemed great by men. But man having by sinne deprived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of that inward greatnesse, wherein by God he was made, <hi>Extra quaerit quod intus perdidit, &amp; in semetipso minoratus, magnificat opera sua,</hi> He seeketh without that which was lost within, and being made little in himselfe, who was Gods worke, he striveth to make his owne workes to be great, as <hi>Hugo</hi> speaketh.<note place="margin">Hugo de Sancto Vict. in Ecclesiast.

                     <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> saith well, he is truly great, <hi>Qui magna facit, &amp; parva sentit, licet magna sciat,</hi> Who doth great things and thinketh them to be little, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he know them to be great. <hi>I builded me houses;</hi> The weaknesse of mans constitution being not able to endure the inequalities of heate and cold, therefore an house is both usefull and needfull for man. But the pleasure of man transcendeth the bounds of use and need, and hee must build houses, many houses, many houses in one, for the greatnesse of it, and many houses in diverse places, to multiply his vanity. To adde yet unto it, these also must be trimmed with much cost, and more curiosity. <hi>Aurum in aereas membranas dissectum ubi{que} illinitur, ut avidos in se oculos convertat: arbores ita formantur ex ligno, ut putentur ex caelaturis ramos, fructus &amp; folia producere;</hi> Gold being cut into ayrie skinnes and beaten into very thinne leaves, is every where besmeered on them, to turne the greedy eyes to looke upon them: trees are so made out of the wood, that from the carving they may be thought to bring forth branches and leaves and fruit.<note place="margin">Greg. Nyss. in Eccles. Homil. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> But as <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> very well addeth, <hi>In haec studium quod confertur, est reprehensio &amp; insimulatio negligentiae in iis quae sunt priora. Quo enim major fuerit &amp; multitudine &amp; materiae sumptu magnificentia in aedium structuris, eo magis arguitur inornatam esse animam,</hi> The care which is bestowed upon these things doth accuse and reprove the negligence which is in things that are better. For how much the magnificence is greater in the structure of houses, either in respect of the multitude of them, or the cost of the matter, by so much the shame is greater, that the soule is not adorned. Let that be built up carefully; let humility be the pavement of it, let hope be the roofe of it, let faith be the pillars of it; on this side let Iustice be towards men, on that side devotion towards God, <hi>Et haec omnia praeclarus artifex, nempe charitas, apte inter se conjungat,</hi> And let love an excellent Artificer neately joyne all these together, and then there will be a house for wisedome to dwell in. <hi>I planted me Vineyards.</hi> The Preacher having told us, that he made workes, built houses, even as great as mountaines, he sheweth also how hee planted the mountaines with Vineyards. Now a Greeke Father telleth us, <hi>Magnum affectionum catalogum comprehendit vinearum plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationis confessio,</hi> This his confession of the planting of Vineyards containeth a great catalogue of his vaine affections. For as the same addeth, Wine immoderately taken, <hi>Est fomes intemperantiae, pernicies juventutis, probrum senectutis, dedecus mulierum, insaniae pharmacum,</hi> Is the nourishment of intemperancy, the bane of youth, the reproach of old age, the shame of Women, the poison of madnesse. But the Preacher sheweth, that he did not only use that Wine which was to be gotten, but provided also by planting many Vineyards, both for the abundance and delicacy of it. Surely where this mind is, there is commonly no mind to plant the Vineyard of the soule, but there the plants of vertue are suffered to dry up, and wither quite away. Whereas if it were well dressed, well ordered, it would be a most fruitfull Vineyard, so that a man should bruise his Grapes into the cup of wisdome, and drinke that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177008:21"/> Wine which would indeed make his heart merry. Lastly, wee may note in these words, that the Preacher doth kindly expresse the nature of worldly pleasure, which is to bee all for it selfe. And therefore hee saith, <hi>I made me great workes, I builded me houses, I planted me Vineyards.</hi> If these great workes had beene made for some great good ends; if these houses had beene built to lodge strangers, the fatherlesse and wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, if these Vineyards had beene planted to relieve and comfort those; whose Vineyards were spoyled and destroyed, they had beene made, builded, planted for God, and he would have given a reward of blessednesse unto it. But that all was for himselfe made all to be nothing though never so great.</p>

It was not one, but many Paradises that he made, as if he would strive to exceed that delight wherein at first man was placed by God, who made but one Paradise for him. But let sensuall hearts take heed how they suffer themselves to feed too much upon these pleasures, least at length, to use the words of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 7. It is the folly of man, that he is not onely delighted in the vanitie of his owne eyes and of his owne imagination, but also in the vanitie of the eyes of others, and of the imagination that others have of him. The Preacher therefore having shewed, how he tryed his heart with the delight of the one, here he sheweth how he tryed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe also with the delight of the other. For what is the pleasure of a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:177008:23"/> multitude of servants, of a greater multitude of cattell, but that others looke with admiration upon them, and by the great number of them, imagine a great deale of happinesse in him that hath them? And this imagination in others, is that which much increaseth his owne imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his owne greatnesse, which the Preacher here expresseth, saying, <hi>that he had servants and cattell above all that were in Ierusalem before him:</hi> Wherein the pride of man doth even exceed nature, making him to behold himselfe, as if he were not of the same nature, but even of another from all that had foregone him. And in a particular reference to <hi>Solomon,</hi> we may conceive it as an imagination, that he was King not onely over those that lived with him, but as it were a King over all that had been before him, being above them all in his great retinue of servants,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> and possessions of cattle. S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> readeth it, <hi>Mercatus sum servos &amp; ancillas,</hi> I bought me servants and maydens. But as a Greeke Father speaketh, <hi>Quot nummis aestimasti rationem? Quot obolos expendisti pro Dei imagine?</hi> At how many pence diddest thou value reason? At how many halfe-pence diddest thou rate the image of God? Plainly, as if these were vanities, glory in the buying of them. To the servants and maydens that were bought, the Preacher addeth those which were borne in his house; and as if they had been borne of his small and great cattell, so doth he joyne them to his great and small cattell. It being the vaine pride of too many men, to reckon those that are under them no better then beasts. But the Originall calleth them <gap reason="foreign">

For though <hi>Solomon</hi> were great and encreased, yet it was onely <hi>more then they that were in Ierusalem before him:</hi> not more then they that were in the feare of God before him, not more then they that were in vertue and holinesse before him. There is no comparison betweene the greatnesse of the world, and the greatnesse of them. But <hi>Solomon</hi> also telleth us, <hi>that his wisedome remained with him.</hi> And surely he had need to tell us so, for else it might have been feared much, least these worldly delights had spoyled him of that: else it might have been thought, that while he followed after them, he had forsaken that, and while he filled himselfe with the one, he emptied himselfe of the other. Well also it is, that he calleth it <hi>my wisedome,</hi> that is, the wisdome which God gave him, divine and heavenly, for else it might have been doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:177008:25"/> least he had beene deceived, and had thought that to be wisedome, which hath a shadow of wisedome, but is none in truth.

But this was not the wisedome which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> received from heaven, and of which he sayth, <hi>my wisedome conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with me.</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reads it, <hi>Ad stitit mihi,</hi> my wisedome stood by me. <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> reads it <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>stetit mihi,</hi> stood with me: and so doe <hi>Pagnine</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> render it. So that although he increased in worldly greatnesse, yet he did not in wisedome: that stood still. The time and desire which he spent upon worldly delights, left him no time, no desire to looke after the benefiting of himselfe therein. All that he can say, is, and that is much considering his present dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that his wisedome stayd with him. That was at a stay, while he went on from delight to delight. Or else wee may take his meaning, that besides all his other delights, also his wisdome remained with him, as shewing that to be his chiefest delight, and which made up the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all the rest.</p>

                     </note> with reference to this, as <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> doth, then by the remaining of his wisedome with him, he meaneth that his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome served him, to search out delights for him, and to direct him to the greatest of them, and in the greatest to the greatnesse of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. To the wisedome of his understanding, he added the helpe <hi>of his eye,</hi> which is a sense both eager and quicke in hunting after pleasant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.

Yea indeed too bold it is, and too often taketh leave where it is not granted, and yeeldeth to desire, when care laboureth to keepe it away.

For joy it is that the heart of man would have, and yet almost it would not have it, unlesse it might have it in this manner, that it selfe may have a freedome in the choosing of it.

Vnlesse that any one can find profit in vexation of spirit. Lastly, seeing the Preacher useth so often this phrase <hi>under the Sun,</hi> perhaps hee considered,<note place="margin">

Or else the meaning of the phrase is, that as farre and wide as the Sunne shineth there is no true profit to be found upon earth in earthly things. The <hi>insulae fortunatae,</hi> fortunate Ilands, which any one may talke of, are but meere dreames, not lying any where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunnes light.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 12. The Preacher having returned to himselfe, and rightly judged of the vanity of all inferiour and sensuall delights; he turneth himselfe now to view and consider the things belonging to the mind. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> begin the verse thus, <hi>Respexi ut vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:177008:27"/> I looked that I might behold, that is, he carefully looked, that he might understand. For many there are that doe looke upon things, but it is not to behold, it is not to understand them, it is onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they stand in their way, because they offer themselves to their sight. But he that will judge of things, must looke upon them, as here the wise man doth, he must looke upon them, that hee may behold them, he must looke upon them, that he may looke into them. To expresse the passing of the Preacher from one matter to another, the Septuagint, and the Vulgar Latine after them, begin the verse thus, <hi>Transivi ad contemplandum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hugo de Sancto Vict. in hunc vers.</note> I passed to consider; and <hi>Hugo de Sancto Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore</hi> noteth upon it, that <hi>Hebraeus,</hi> and Hebrew in the Originall signifieth <hi>Transeuntem</hi> one that passeth along, as if the King were made a right Hebrew herein. For let the heathen boast of what they can, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes were the first that attained to humane wisdome, and knowledge. But to passe on with the Preacher. <hi>To behold wisedome and madnesse and folly:</hi> by <hi>wisdome</hi> I understand a Philosophicall prudence, by <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> the curiosity of men, either in pursuing after things above their strength, or in pleasing themselves with their owne toyes, by <hi>folly</hi> the simplicity of men in not perceaving or misapprehending the right course of things. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> supposeth these two to be added to wisdome, as noting the wisdome to which man attaineth,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Plus erroris stultitiae{que} habere quam verae certae{que} prudentiae. Ita{que} illa quae novimus, opinari nos potius quam tenere, &amp; aestimare magis quam scire quod verum est,</hi> To have in it more errour and folly, then true and certaine wisdome. And therefore that even those things which we doe know, wee doe rather imagine then apprehend, and doe suppose rather then conceive that which is right. Now this doth well agree with that reading which a Greeke Father hath of the latter part of the verse, who saith, <hi>Quis est ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, qui ingredietur post consilium ea, quaecun{que} ipsum fecit?</hi> Who is the man that will enter after counsell into all those things, which counsell it selfe hath made? To which the answer is implyed, it is madnesse and folly to attempt it, it is madnesse and folly that is attained by it. Where the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is translated counsell, according to the Chaldee signification of it: and <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> telleth us, that by counsell in the latter part, is understood that wisdome whereof the first part of the verse speaketh. But to take madnesse and folly, as they are plainely opposed to wisdome, it is well noted by <hi>Hugo,</hi> that first he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wisdome,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. in Ecclesiast. Homil. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> as thereby comming to behold madnesse and folly. For as he speaketh, <hi>Nemo ad tenebras vadit ut videat tenebras, sed ad lucem venit ut videat per lucem, non solum lucem, sed &amp; tenebras &amp; lucem,</hi> No one goeth to darknesse, that he may see darknesse; but he commeth to the light, that by the light he may see, not only light, but light and darknesse also. First therefore the Preacher saith, that <hi>hee beheld wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> that so he might behold <hi>In ipsâ quod ipsa est sapientia, &amp; per ipsam, errores &amp; stultitiam, quod ipsa non est sapientia,</hi> In wisedome it selfe, what it selfe is, and by it selfe madnesse and folly, which wisedome it selfe is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177008:27"/> not, as <hi>Hugo</hi> addeth. The last part of the verse the Septuagint doe read in a much different manner: and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, that from their reading, <hi>Multum in hoc loco sensus diversus est,</hi> much in this place is the sense different. But I doe not see, but that the sense also is as much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the reading which himselfe bringeth. Our translation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with <hi>Tremellius,</hi> but that it agreeth fully with the Originall is more than I perceive. I desiring to come as neere to the Originall, as I could, should render it thus, for what is that man, who shall attaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King, to that which they have already made him? That is, to that which wisdome, and the knowledge of madnesse and folly have made him: thereby implying the perfection to which he had attained, so that he was the better able to judge of these things. There is in this verse, and the former, and in some other verses, a kind of emphaticall use of the pronoune <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>ego,</hi> I turned my selfe. And I conceive that it is so used by the Preacher; thereby to shew unto us, that it was a thing, which he did of himselfe, and of his owne setled purpose; and that it was not done by the meanes of any other occasion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 13. <hi>Then I saw,</hi> That is, hee had no sooner turned himselfe to behold, but he saw presently the excellency of wisdome above folly: it being so great, so manifest, that it appeared forthwith, and was as clearely discerned as the excellency of light is above the darknesse. But yet he saw, before he judged; he did not rashly deliver his sentence, as the manner of too many is, commending things and preferring them before others, before they see any good cause why to doe it. Of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Quae probat videt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. Hexam. l. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; quae videt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,</hi> Those things which he approveth he seeth, and those things which he seeth he approveth; and so it is with those that feare God, they doe not approve any thing but that which they see to be good, neither doe they delight to see any thing, but that which for the goodnesse of it, they approve. And fitly is it said, that he saw the excellency of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> also saith, <hi>Bonorum proprium est,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambrosus Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>ut exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no commendatore non egeant, sed gratiam suam quum videntur ipsa testan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Plus est quod probatur aspectu, quam quod sermone laudatur,</hi> It is the property of good things, that they doe not need an externall prayser, but themselves when they are seene, doe testifie their grace. It is a greater excellency which is approved by sight, then that is which is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by speech. Againe by this phrase hee doth properly set out the nature of wisdome, <hi>Quae videndo complacet, quoniam ipsa videndi offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um subministrat,</hi> which pleaseth in being seene, because it is it selfe which giveth ability of rightly seeing things. <hi>Then I saw that wisdome excelleth folly:</hi> It is a humane wisdome whereof I conceive him to speake, which therefore though he could not free from vanity, yet doth he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre before folly, as <hi>much as light is to be preferred before darknesse.</hi> Now light hath God himselfe for the praiser of it, and it is the first thing that God praised. Let there bee light, is the first word that God ever spake, and that God saw the light to be good, is the first praise that God ever
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:177008:28"/> gave.<note place="margin">Ambr. Jbid.</note> Wherefore Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Vnde vox Dei in divina Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura debuit inchoare, nisi a lumine?

From whence should the beauty of the world take his beginning, but from the lights excellency? Assoone as God had made the light, hee divided the darkenesse from it, as if he would not have the excellency thereof to be dishonoured by the company of it: or as shewing the unworthinesse of darknesse, as not being fit to be joyned with light. Let it therefore be our care also, to divide wisdome from folly: the society of the one doth much shame the other, and indeed most unworthy is folly, so much as to be joyned in comparison with wisdome.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 14. <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> speaking of this verse saith, <hi>Estne ullum animal eorum qui caput habent, quod habaet oculos extra caput?</hi> Is there any living creature which hath a head, and hath not his eyes in his head? What is this therefore, that the Preacher saith of a wiseman, that he hath his eyes in his head? The answer which hee giveth is this. That Christ is the head of a wiseman, and that his eyes are fixed upon Christ.<note place="margin">Greg. Mag. Moral. l. <hi>17.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> And so doth Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the great expound or rather apply the words saying, <hi>Sapiens quisque illum tota intentione considerat, cujus se membrum per fidem pensat,</hi> Every wise man thinketh upon him with the whole intention of his mind, a member of whom by faith he conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himselfe to be.<note place="margin">Olympiod. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> expounding the words, more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saith, That a <hi>Wise man hath his eyes in his head, Quia ad suprema visum &amp; animum erectum habet, coelestia meditatur, cogitat{que} illa quae Dei sunt, non contemplante illo quae videntur, sed quae non videntur,</hi> Because he hath his sight and his mind lifted up unto the highest things, he meditateth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, he thinketh on the things of God, he mindeth not those things which are seene, but those things which are not seene. <hi>Gregor. Neocaesariensis</hi> expounding those words saith, <hi>Sicut sapienter Deus custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des oculos in capite collocavit ut longius pertingere visu possint; Sic sapiens in capite ponit visum, h. e. intellectum suum (hic est oculus animae) h.e. ita ut quae à longe sunt prospicere valeat,</hi> As God hath wisely placed those keepers, the eyes in the head, from whence their sight is able to reach farre; so a wise man placeth his sight, that is, his understanding (for that is the eye of the soule) in his head, that is, so, that hee may bee able to discerne those things which are a farre of, as namely what shall bee at death, what after death, what account hee shall give to God, what in hell the damned suffer, what in heaven the blessed enjoy. And then going on and expounding the next words he saith, <hi>But the foole walketh in darknesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Greg. Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caesariensis in hunc vers.</note> that is, <hi>Ignorat haec omnia, &amp; qui haec ignorat, caecus &amp; stul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est, quamvis omnes mundi scientias norit,</hi> Is ignorant of all these things, and hee that is ignorant of these things is blind and a foole, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he have all the knowledge of the world. Wherefore a Greeke Father also saith, <hi>Verae sunt tenebroe acer visus in sensibilibus,</hi> A sharp sight in worldly things is indeed true darkenesse. A foole then hath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177008:28"/> not his eyes in his head but in his heeles, <hi>Nam quando vis animae contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plativa occupatur in rebus sensibilibus, in ejus calcaneos oculorum transit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi> For when the contemplative power of the soule is busied in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, the nature of the eyes passeth to the heeles, which the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent pursueth, and biteth with his teeth, as <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> also hath it. But if we take the wise man here to be a humane wise man, we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>his eyes to be in his head,</hi> because he looketh <hi>in capita et principia rerum,</hi> into the causes and beginnings of things, and marketh what is chiefely to be regarded in them; <hi>whereas a foole walketh in darknesse,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther considering from whence things come and arise, neither whither they goe, nor to what they tend. A wise man seeth what is past, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeth what is to come, and accordingly ordereth his wayes; whereas a foole, looketh no farther then the present, and when evill is present to seise upon him, then onely seeth it. A wise man is sharp-sighted and circumspect, marking all circumstances for the right doing of any thing; wheras a foole goeth on in a confused blind manner in all that he doth. But against this preferring of wisedome before folly, as much as light is before darknesse: against this placing of a wise man above a foole, as much as the head is above the feete, the Preacher objecteth, <hi>That one event happeneth to them all:</hi> he sayth not to them both, but to all of both; to all wise men, to all fooles. And this objection he sayth that others need not to make, but that himselfe also <hi>perceived it,</hi> himselfe made it in his minde, and that thereupon he sayd in his heart, as the next verse sheweth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 15. I have not omitted to give such usefull expositions of the former verses, as the words would beare. But the wisedome wherof the twelfth verse speaketh, being as I conceive to be understood of humane prudence and understanding: in the thirteenth verse, that is sayd to give light to him that hath it, and therefore to preferre him before the ignorant who is in darknesse: in the fourteenth verse it is sayd to be the eyes of the wise man, because he seeth farre into the natures, conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, causes, reasons, circumstances, vertues, operations, events of things; whereas the foole walking in darknesse, seeth not the things that are obvious unto him, and lie before his feete when he walketh. But against this the Preacher objecteth, that although the wise man seeth so farre into the nature and condition of things, and into the event of them, yet that one event happeneth to them all. And to this objection answering in this fifteenth verse; first of all he granteth it; secondly, he applyeth it; thirdly, he repineth at it; fourthly, he delivereth his sentence upon it. He granteth it in these words, <hi>Then sayd I in my heart,</hi> I sayd that it was so, and in my heart confessed it to be true. He applyeth it in these words, <hi>As it happeneth to the foole, so it happeneth even to me,</hi> I cannot deny it in my selfe, of whom it cannot be denyed, that my wisedome is the greatest of any. He repineth in these words, <hi>And why was I then more wise?</hi> Why did I take so much paines to be wise? Why did I so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully search into the nature and condition of things, forecast the events
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:177008:29"/> of things? He delivereth his sentence in these words, <hi>Then I sayd in my heart, that this is also vanitie.</hi> Then I concluded of it, and sayd in my heart, when I had considered of it, <hi>that this is also vanitie.</hi> And that we may not thinke it to be a small matter which he sayth,<note place="margin">Ambros. de Abrah. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth, <hi>Quid deterius vanitate?</hi> What is worse then vanitie? The vanitie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this verse speaketh, is this, That all the learning and wisedome of man, is not able to dispose of the event of things, but that as they fall out to fooles, so oftentimes to wise men. And therefore I may use the words of S. <hi>Austin,</hi> though not in his sense, <hi>Ambulat homo in imagine veritatis,</hi>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:177008:29"/> verse to be proposed by the Preacher in the person of some other, and that rejecting it himselfe, he sayth, <hi>This is also vanitie.</hi> Accordingly therefore in this verse, he conceiveth the Preacher to confirme his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of it. And when the Preacher sayth, <hi>Non est memoria sapientis cum stulto in aeternum,</hi> The remembrance of the wise man is not with the foole for ever (for so the Originall goes) he conceiveth it, That the memory of the wise man is for ever, but the memory of the foole is not so. And therefore that although both dye, yet the dying of both is not alike. For as <hi>Hugo</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. in Ecclesiast. Hom. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Sapientia quae vitae praesenti mortalitatem non tollit, futurae vitae tribuit aeternitatem,</hi> Wisedome which doth not take away the mortalitie of this present life, giveth eternitie to the life to come. And whereas the Preacher sayth, <hi>The things which now are, in the dayes to come shall be forgotten, Gregory Nyssene</hi> understandeth them of the things of a foole. Lastly, whereas the Preacher sayth, <hi>How dyeth the wise man? as the foole.</hi> (For so the Originall may be well rendred) he conceiveth it in this manner. How therefore doth any one say, that the one dyeth as the other? For as <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> also sayth, <hi>Quare unâ viâ ab hac vita exeunt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>qui post hanc vitam ad unum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium non pertingunt?</hi> Why doe they goe the same way out of this life, who after this life doe not come unto the same reward? But to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this passage of the prudent and foolish, learned and unlearned; for so in this place the Septuagint, and after them the Vulgar Latin doe reade it, saying, <hi>Mo itur doctus similiter et indoctus,</hi> The learned dyeth as well as the unlearned. And to take <hi>Solomon</hi> as granting the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made in the fourteenth verse, here he confirmeth the truth of it by another argument; because the memory of the wiseman, as well as of the foole doth not abide for ever. They are the words of King <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric</hi> in <hi>Cassiodore,</hi> though there uttered in another sense,<note place="margin">Cassiodoru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Magnum benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium, oblivionis nescire defectum, &amp; quaedam similitudo verè coelestium est,</hi> It is a great benefit, not to know the decay of forgetfulnesse, and it is a kinde of similitude of true heavenly things. But it is the condition of a wise man as well as of a foole to be forgotten: and though a wise man may be remembred somewhat longer then a foole; yet in respect of for ever, they are both forgotten alike. For in that, in eternitie, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the <hi>Iam,</hi> the now <hi>dierum transeuntium</hi> of dayes that passe away is wholy swallowed up, wholy forgotten; in which manner I conceive the Originall words to be most fitly translated. And though while the wise man and the foole live, there be some difference betweene them, yet when they are dead, in respect of the memory of them for ever there is no difference. For so I understand the last part of the verse in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the former, and doe not take it to be another argument, proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the equalitie of them, <hi>in that they both dye.</hi> But yet seeing the words may be so taken, it may be considered, that though the learned man know many things, yet he knoweth not how to escape death, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his skill. And as <hi>Seneca</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note>
                     <hi>Errores fortunae mors inevitabilis reformat,</hi> inevitable death reformeth the errours of fortune, making the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177008:30"/> rich and poore, noble and ignoble alike; So it may be sayd, <hi>Differenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as scientiae mors confundit,</hi> The differences of learning death confoundeth, and shuts up both learned and unlearned in the grave. <hi>Laertius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Laertius.</note> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that <hi>Alexander</hi> seeing <hi>Diogenes</hi> tumbling among dead bones, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him what he sought, to whom the other replyed, that which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde, the difference betweene the rich and the poore. And he that shall seeke there the difference betweene the learned and unlearned, shall never finde it also. Wherefore this may well quell the pride of any ones wisedome, any ones learning: and let this make every wise man, to seeke that happinesse, wherein not onely his memory but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe shall be immortall.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177008:31"/> which was gathered and laboured for, many dayes and nights. And those things which an idle vanitie scraped together, an hostile crueltie taketh as ready prey: fifthly, because himselfe must goe away, that the other may come <hi>after him,</hi> and enjoy his labours: lastly, because he doth leave his labours to those, who shall also goe away as himselfe doth.<note place="margin">Augustin.

In the beginning of the verse, the Pronoune <hi>I,</hi> in the Originall is used with an Emphasis, as noting that he was the same who now did hate, who before did love, and that as he had given himselfe to delight in the things of this life, so he could take away himselfe againe, and make himselfe to hate them.<note place="margin">Gregor.

Now let the consideration of this verse, make us in our hearts to leave our worldly goods, before that we leave them in the world. And if any hatred arise in us by reason of this misery, let it be against our sinnes the cause of it, not against our labour, wherein we are by God appointed to imploy our time.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 19. From the more generall complaint, of not knowing who shall come after, the Preacher descendeth to a more particular complaint, of not knowing, whether he that commeth after shall <hi>be a wise man, or a foole.</hi> If he be a wise man, then he complaineth, that he shall <hi>have rule over all his labour, wherein he hath laboured,</hi> and that when he hath taken the paines and care, another shall enjoy the comfort and pleasure of it: if he be a foole, then he complaineth, that he should have authoritie over his labour, <hi>wherein he hath shewed himselfe wise under the Sunne.</hi> Or else wee may suppose the Preacher, to speake onely of the foole, and to omit to speake of the wise man, that should come after him, as being contented with his owne losse, so that a wise man might gaine his labour and succeed him in it. But that a foole should be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of his labour, as if himselfe had been a servant to him in it; this he sayth <hi>is a great vanitie.</hi> For though our English <hi>Also</hi> doth not expresse this unto us, yet the Originall <gap reason="foreign">

Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> because the Preacher speaketh of <hi>shewing his wisdome</hi> will not have the verse to bee understood of worldly things, for saith hee, what wisedome is there in them? He therefore expoundeth the place of the labours of spirituall wisedome in writing of bookes, wherein a man having laboured night and day, yet they may come into the hands of fooles, who thence may take the seeds of heresie, and bring a slander upon them. A Greeke Father marking those words, hee expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them another way, and saith, It is not the manner of every one, <hi>cognitionis causa dimittere sensum, ad faciendum harum rerum peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum. Quod quidem ego inquit, per sapientiam feci,</hi> For experience sake to let loose his sensuall delight, thereby to get a tryall of these things, which I by wisedome was able for to doe. For suffering the desire of nature, as it were a young Colt, <hi>Libere in inferioribus parumper exultare animi motibus,</hi> A little while to sport it selfe freely in the inferiour mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the soule, I did againe reine it backe by reason, and made it subject to my power. But who can tell, whether hee that shall have rule over my things, will not rather serve his pleasure, then keepe a ruling hand over it, and so like a foole, make my riches and abundance the matter of his wickednesse. But the plainest sense is to understand here a humane wisedome, which <hi>Solomon</hi> having shewed in his great workes, strong Castles, stately buildings which he had made, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth that they should come to a foole coming after him, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would discerne the wisdome of them, nor have wit how to use them. This therefore should make Parents carefull to bring up their children in knowledge, and the practise of godlinesse, that so the hope of their religious and discreete lives when themselves are dead, may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish this misery while they are yet alive.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 20. We have here <hi>Solomon</hi> turning another way, for so the Originall most directly soundeth, saying, <hi>Then I turned my selfe to make my heart despaire.</hi> For faine would his heart find contentment, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it could not be found in the vanity of his labour, he turned his heart to a carelesnesse of his labours, not regarding what did become of them: seeing he could not find it in the vexation of his spirit, he turned his heart to a secure despaire of spirit: there being some imaginary contentment in this,<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psal. <hi>129.</hi>
                     </note> where none else is to bee had. But as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh, <hi>Fallax foelicitas, ipsa est major infoelicitas,</hi> a deceitfull happines is in it selfe a greater unhappinesse; and whatsoever the ease of this course may be to a distressed mind, it is in it self the greater misery. But <hi>Solomon</hi> would try all, and therfore here he saith, <hi>that he made his heart despaire, and that of all his labour which he took under the Sunne,</hi> as well of his better la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as of his worser, as well of his labour of wisdome, as of his labour to delight his senses, <hi>of all,</hi> because where there is any hope, there is no despaire. Now here wee have set downe the two causes of despaire, first vanity, secondly vexation. Vanity is a great cause of despaire, for when men have laboured hard, and find no successe, that makes them to despaire of any successe. Thus he that hath taken paines, and tryed many wayes to recall some one from his sinfull courses, but cannot doe it, he despaires of amendment. But as vanity is the cause of this despaire, so the despaire is vanity.<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psal. <hi>55.</hi>
                     </note> Wherefore Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>Noli dicere, nunquid ecce talem hominem Deus correcturus est tam, malum tam perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum?</hi> Doe not say, what will God ever amend such a man, so wicked, so perverse? <hi>Noli desperare; quem rogas attende, non pro quo rogas: mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudinem morbi vides, potentiam medici non vides,</hi> Doe not despaire, look to him, to whom thou prayest, doe not looke on him for whom thou prayest: thou seest the greatnesse of the disease, thou dost not see the power of the Physitian. Secondly, vexation of mind is a great cause of despaire; for when the mind is vexed and cannot find comfort, then
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:177008:32"/> it seeketh comfort in not seeking of it. Thus when a haynous sinner is tortured in his Conscience, and cannot get ease, then his ease is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of pardon, then he saith, <hi>Fruar hoc saeculo in voluptate, in lascivia, in cupiditate nefaria: jam perdita spe reparationis, vel habeam quod video, si non possum habere quod credo,</hi> I will enjoy this life, in pleasure, in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, and in the desires of sinne: now the hope of recovery being lost, yet let mee have that which I see, if I cannot have that which I beleeve.

But what was his offence here? One tels us, <hi>Illum David statim morte dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit, quum percussum ab hoste desperasset esse victurum, &amp; eum sublata spei fiducia jugulasset,</hi> Therefore did <hi>David</hi> slay him, because when the King was wounded by the enemy, he despaired of his life, and that having no confidence of hope he had killed the Lords annoynted. For he should have used his best diligence to have preserved <hi>Saul,</hi> and not by despaire of helpe, to say he could not live. And surely whether the danger bee our owne, or the danger of any other, we must never despaire, that will make our owne case the more dangerous, the case of others the more remedilesse: and what ease so ever wee may finde in it, it may easily bring evill upon us. But to returne to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and to his turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to a carelesse negligence in despaire of things, it serveth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the never wearied covetousnesse of some, the never tyred am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of others, who notwithstanding the vanity, and vexation that the Preacher sheweth, yet have no stop nor stay of themselves.</p>

                     <hi>animi magnitudo,</hi> a courage or greatnesse of mind, by Pagnine and <hi>Arias Montanus, rectitudo</hi> a rightnesse, but as I conceive, the French doth translate it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, <hi>adressè,</hi> a right directing and ordering of things. <hi>There is</hi> (saith the Preacher) <hi>a man,</hi> that is, though there be not many such, yet there is a man; and it may be speaking of himselfe and in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:177008:33"/> of himselfe, therefore hee saith indefinitely there is a man, <hi>whose labour is</hi> (and I take the Originall to note the labour with some empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis) <hi>in wisdome knowledge and equity.</hi> Which may be understood two wayes, either that wisedome knowledge and equity, were the things wherein hee laboured, or else that his labour was about other things, and that they were done in wisedome, knowledge, and equity. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> will not have the verse by any meanes to be understood this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, for saith he, <hi>Quid ad opes terrae pertinent sapientia, scientia, virtus, in quibus se laborasse testatus est, quum sapientiae, scientiae, atque virtutis sit cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care terrena,</hi> What doe wisdome, and knowledge and vertue belong to the glorious things of the earth, wherein hee testifieth that hee labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? When as it belongeth to wisdome, knowledge, and vertue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise earthly things. And because the Preacher hath before spoken of his labour in wisdome according to this sense, in the nineteenth verse, therefore I doe here rather conceive him to speake in the former sense. And yet if any like better the other meaning, then he may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish, wisedome, knowledge, rightnesse in this sort. First, that his labour was in wisdome, because he had layd a wise foundation for it, and for the beginning of it: Secondly, that it was in knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he proceeded on according to knowledge: and, Thirdly, in right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because he directed and ordered it to a right end; or else in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because it was without iniquity. According to the other meaning we may distinguish them thus. First, that his labour was in wisedome in respect of higher things: Secondly, in knowledge, in respect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things: Thirdly, in rightnesse, in respect of a right ordering and directing the affaires of this life, or else in equity, in respect of a just ordering of them. Otherwise they may be distinguished thus. First, that his labour was in wisdome for the matter of it: in knowledge for the manner of it; in rightnesse for the end of it, or else in equity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of an equall and indifferent judgement in the pursuite of it. Hee addeth, <hi>Yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion.</hi> Now if we follow the latter meaning of the former words, then the Preachers complaint is, that he shall leave his labour to one who hath not laboured with him,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> and as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor mortui erunt delitiae viventis,</hi> the sweate of the dead shall bee the baths of delight to the living. If wee embrace the former meaning of the former words, then the Preachers complaint is, that hee shall leave his labour to him, who hath not laboured in wisedome, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, rightnesse: but being <hi>Otiosus</hi> an idle person, as the Septuagint have it, hath not taken the paines to bee acquainted with them. And therefore <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> expounding it saith,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sancto Vict. in Eccles. Homil. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Nonnunquam sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentium negligentia hoc paratum in usum assumere respuit, quod priorum sagax diligentia non sine grandi labore ac cura acquisivit,</hi> Oftentimes the negligence of them that come after, refuseth to make use of that which is made ready for them, and which the wise diligence of those that went before, obtained with great labour and care. Our translation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177008:33"/> saith, <hi>leave it,</hi> but the Originall saith <hi>give it.</hi> And perhaps that word is rather to bee used, as shewing that the Preacher speaketh of leaving it to some, either child, or kinsman, or friend: and perhaps thereby the Preacher also aggravateth his complaint, as shewing that it should be his owne deed, and that himselfe should bestow his labours of worth upon an unworthy person: which though he doth in love, yet hee is as it were sorry that hee should doe it. Wherefore hee concludeth. <hi>This also is vanity and a great evill.</hi> First it is <hi>vanity,</hi> because it is as <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> speaketh, <hi>In cognitione veritatis laborare, ut in notitiam illorum venia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, qui veritatem nec propter se suscipere volunt, nec in aliis sciunt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare,</hi> To labour in the knowledge of truth, that wee may come into their knowledge, who neither will embrace the truth for themselves, nor know how to approve of it in others. Secondly, it is <hi>evill, Quae si quaerenti labor est, &amp; accipienti utilitas non est,</hi> because if it bee labour to the seeker, and no profit to the receiver, how can it choose, as one speaketh, but be evill? Thirdly, it is <hi>a great evill, Quia &amp; ille malo suo colligit, &amp; iste accipit in malum,</hi> Because the one doth gather it with his evill of labour, the other doth receive it to his evill of shame, as the same Author also goeth on. Or else wee may apply the vanity to the great labour lost, the evill to the idle not-labouring person, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the evill to this, that hee must leave it, who could and would make use of it; that he shall have it, who neither will be nor can bee the better for it. That which our translation hath, <hi>for his portion,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Originall may bee understood of the labourer, as shewing that to be his portion, the portion of his labour, which hee leaveth to another, that laboured not for it. And if wee understand it of the portion of his estate in this world, a good way to ease the great evill and vanity of it, is to give a good part of it, to GOD and to pious uses, which shall not want a reward. But so cold is the devotion of many herein, that rather than they will give any thing to GOD of whom they have received all, even when they have no children, no kindred, they will give it to a stranger for names sake, or for some other as poore a reason.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. The Preacher here laboureth to expresse the labour of man. For there is <hi>labour,</hi> but it is without <hi>vexation of heart,</hi> and though the body toyle, the head worke hard, yet the heart is at rest. There is also <hi>vexation of spirit,</hi> but it is without <hi>labour:</hi> and though the heart be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with care, or feare, or desire unsatisfied, or such like passion; yet the body is at ease, the head is not troubled with study to finde out knowledge. But both these are the condition of man, even <hi>labour</hi> to tire him, and <hi>vexation of heart</hi> to spend him. But it is more also then these, which is mans burden. For he <hi>laboureth in the vexation of his heart,</hi> and it is his labour how to put his heart to the greatest vexation, and his heart is even vexed that it is not more vexed. <hi>And all this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne,</hi> all is for the vaine things of this world. For <hi>Quid prode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit homini? What will it profit a man?</hi> saith the Septuagint. What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit hath hee to recompence this labour? <hi>Quid superest? What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to a man?</hi> saith <hi>Tremellius,</hi> What is remaining to a man when all this labour is ended? <hi>Quid fit homini? What is done for a man?</hi> saith Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> What is done for a man, when he hath done, and suffered so much? <hi>What hath a man?</hi> saith our English, when he hath had such labour, such vexation of heart? Hee proposeth it as a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and as a wise man, thinking that though himselfe might not bee able to tell, although hee had sought much to know it, yet that some other might know. Hee therefore proposeth it to any one to tell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Sometimes a question is made, as importing that no answer can be made unto it: but here though the question may expect an answer, yet it supposeth the answer to be nothing. For when it is asked, <hi>What hath a man of all his labour?</hi> Perhaps some one may answer, as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> hath it,<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psal. <hi>50.</hi>

The Preacher therefore sayth, <hi>That all mans dayes are sorrowes,</hi> his sorrowes begin when his dayes beginne, his sorrowes goe on, as his dayes goe on, as the <hi>travell</hi> of his journey proceedeth, so his <hi>griefe</hi> proceedeth, as he passeth from one businesse to another, so he passeth from one griefe to another. Yea, many are the sorrowes of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day unto him, <hi>his travell is but one continued griefe;</hi> his businesse is onely the worke of griefe. Sorrow is the Sunne that makes his dayes unto him: it is that which makes him to see himselfe, to see his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when his Sunne is so blacke, what are his dayes? <hi>In the night</hi> he doth not labour, but yet he <hi>doth not rest:</hi> his body doth not labour, but his heart is not quiet.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 24. As our translation readeth this verse, it may well be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as the speech of a voluptuous person: and whereas the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher had shewed, the sorrow and labour of mans life, and the vanitie of both, in that another enjoyeth the content of it; thereupon it may be supposed that such a one should say, <hi>There is nothing better, then that a man should freely eate and drinke, and give himselfe to pleasure.</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it followes, as the Septuagint have it, <hi>Et hoc de manu Dei est,</hi> and this is from the hand of God: An ancient writer noteth, that there be some men who say, <hi>Devoremus &amp; inebriemur, &amp; benefaciamus nobis ex iis quae Deus dedit nobis, quia et hoc de manu Dei est, quia et haec ideo data sunt nobis, ut bene nobis faciamus,</hi> Let us devoure and be drunken, and doe unto our selves good by those things which God hath given us, for even this is from the hand of God, and therefore are these things given us,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:177008:35"/> that we should doe good to our selves with them. But as he addeth, <hi>Et si Deus bona omnia ad usum fecit, ad pravos tamen et inordinatos usus nihil fecit,</hi> Although God hath made all things good for use, yet he hath made nothing for bad and inordinate uses. But the Originall being, <hi>Non est bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num homini quod comedat &amp; bibat,</hi> It is not the good that belongeth to man, to eate and to drinke, I conceive the Preachers meaning to be this, that having before shewed the vanitie of mans life in the griefe and paines of it, and in providing for the contentment of others, here he sheweth the enjoying of a mans owne contentment, which he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by eating and drinking, because therein it appeareth most plainly, not to be the good of man, and in the last verse of this Chapter he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth it to be vanitie. The not goodnesse, in truth, of it, the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall declareth, in that it sayth, <hi>Vt ostendat animae suae bonum in labore suo,</hi> and that he shew himselfe good in his labour. For it is but a shewing of good to the soule, it is not a right enjoying of it. And yet the Preacher granteth, that this is <hi>from God.</hi> He sayth that <hi>himselfe saw it</hi> to be so, as noting, that he did not forget this, when yet he pronounced it not to be the good belonging unto man.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 25. In the two last verses of this Chapter, the Preacher prooveth the two parts of the former verse. First, he proveth in this verse that a mans owne enjoying of the good of this life, is not the good of man: secondly, he prooveth in the last verse that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of it, is from the Lord. The force of the proofe in this verse is thus set downe by <hi>Lyra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Experto credendum est: Ego autem supra omnes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertus sum, &amp; tamen dixi quod in hoc non consistit bonum hominis, propter quod est mihi credendum,</hi> To him that hath tryed, beliefe is to be given: but I have tryed above all others, and yet I say that the good of man doth not consist in this, wherefore I must be beleeved. And <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> delivering the force of the proofe to the same effect, he sets it downe thus,<note place="margin">Greg. Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. in Eccles. Homil. <hi>5.</hi> Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Haec ego dixi voce mea,</hi> This have I sayd with my voyce. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> makes this verse, to beginne the proofe of the latter part of the former verse, who reads it thus; <hi>Quis enim comedit, &amp; quis parcit sine illo, qui homini bono coram se dedit?</hi> For who eateth, and who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth without him, who giveth to a man, that is good in his sight? <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> doth reade it also, with some reference unto the same manner: So that the copies of the Originall may seeme not to have been the same in this verse. The Septuagint may be thought rather to have delivered the sense of the place, then to have followed the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the words. For they say, <hi>Quis ita devorabit, &amp; delitiis affluet ut ego,</hi> Who shall so devoure, and abound with delights as I? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hugo</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. in Ecclesiast. Hom. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Mala gloriatio ista, &amp; sunt tamen, qui in ejusmodi glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur,</hi> This is a bad glorying, and yet there are that doe glory in these things. But as he addeth, <hi>Si nemo potest, quod tu potes; magnum est, si bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num potes. Si vero amplius in malo potes, quid gloriaris? Malum enim posse, potestas non est, sed infirmitas,</hi> If none can doe that which thou canst, it is a great matter, if it be good which thou canst. But if thou canst doe more in evill, why dost thou then glory? To be able to doe evill, is not a power, but a weaknesse. As the Originall words are now found, it is no easie matter, according to the signification of them, to render the force of them. Our translation is verball enough, but yet thereby not so plaine. Let me with submission offer mine apprehension. I conceive the Preacher in this verse to set forth his abundant enjoying of the good of this life, two wayes. First, by the lowd and free cry of his command and authoritie for it, secondly, by the readinesse and speed that was used in obedience unto it, for the satisfying of his desire. And therefore I take the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> here used as it signifieth to cry, or to call aloud; and so should render the verse according to this sense, Who can call for, more freely? Who can enjoy more speedily, the good of this life then I can? And therefore who should also be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved rather then I; who deny the enjoying of the good of this life to be the good of man? From hence we may take this lesson, that no one doe promise to himselfe, or take upon himselfe those things, which those who have been farre more able then himselfe, have not been able to performe. And for an instance, let not those promise to themselves

                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in Eccles.</note> Elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is sayd that God giveth to a good man, because unlesse he be good, God is not so properly sayd to give unto him. And therefore when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it is sayd, to the sinner he giveth, <hi>Lyra</hi> expoundeth it,<note place="margin">Lyra in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note>
                     <hi>i. e. dari permisit,</hi> he permitted it to be given to him. <hi>Wisedome and knowledge and joy.</hi> The Chaldee Paraphrast doth distinguish these three words thus,<note place="margin">Chald. Para.</note>
                     <hi>Viro cujus opera sunt recta, coram Domino, dedit sapientiam &amp; scientiam in hoc saeculo, &amp; laetitiam cum justis in saeculo venturo,</hi> To the man whose workes are right before the Lord, he giveth <hi>wisedome and knowledge</hi> in this world, and <hi>joy</hi> with the righteous in the world to come. But to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the words with a more particular reference to the place. By <hi>wisedome</hi> we may understand a wise desire to enjoy the things which he hath; by <hi>knowledge,</hi> a discerning of the manner how to enjoy them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; and by <hi>joy</hi> the comfort of enjoying of them. All which none can have, but from God alone. <hi>But to the sinner he giveth:</hi> it is not added, to him that is a sinner in his sight. For a sinner doth not tary in his sight: and God also turneth away his eye from him, as he hath turned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe away from Gods law. Wherefore that which God giveth him, is but from the not giving of his mercy to him. And it is therefore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, not joy, it is a carking solicitousnesse, not wisedome, to gather; not a contented wisedome to use that which is gathered: it is a greedy knowledge how to heape up, not a delightfull knowledge how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy with comfort that which is heaped up: and <hi>the gathering the heaping</hi> is but to fill Gods hand, <hi>that he may give to him,</hi> who shall use it, imploy it in a thankfull joy. And yet <hi>this,</hi> this which God giveth, this which a good man receiveth, <hi>this is also vanitie and vexation of spirit.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> sayth, <hi>Qui hoc esse bonum judicat,</hi>

                     <hi>ignorat se bonum definire in eo quod vacuum est,</hi> He that judgeth this to be good, knoweth not that he defineth good in that which is vaine. <hi>Vanitie</hi> it is because although God giveth it, yet he taketh it away againe: <hi>Vanitie</hi> it is, because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a good man hath it, yet by that he is not made the better. <hi>Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of spirit it is,</hi> because although wisedome desire it, yet wisedome seeth no hope of keeping it: <hi>vexation it is,</hi> because although knowledge discerne how to use it, yet it knoweth not how to continue the use of it: <hi>vexation it is,</hi> although it be joy, because joy that is to be parted with, cannot but vex.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Preacher having ended the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter with the good enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the good things of this life, and with the vanitie which yet is therein: he beginneth this Chapter by shewing how they may be well enjoyed, namely, by taking them <hi>in their time and season,</hi> and withall by shewing their vanitie, in that they have but <hi>a time and season.</hi> More gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally wee may note, that the Preacher having before shewed the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of humane things from his owne experience in himselfe; here he goeth on to shew it, from those things which his experience had obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:177008:37"/> in others: wherein wee are taught, first to looke upon our selves, and to marke our owne wayes, and then to cast our eye on those things which are done by others. But to consider the verse. The Originall words here used for <hi>time</hi> are in the first place <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifying properly <hi>determinatum tempus,</hi> a set appointed time, in the latter place <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying properly <hi>opportunum tempus,</hi> an opportune time. And therefore it seemeth to mee that the words may bee rather transposed thus, To every thing there is a time, and a season to every purpose under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For so also a Greeke Father doth read it, putting in the first place <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which signifieth time, putting in the second place <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which signifieth the opportunity of time. But in expounding the meaning of the verse he putteth another difference betweene them. And because time is the common measure of all things, by <hi>time</hi> he understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth measure, and so conceiveth the Preacher to require two things in the well doing of every thing: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>summetriam &amp; oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitatem,</hi> a fit measure and a convenient opportunity. But he taketh his measure of the verse somewhat awry. To consider then the verse as we read it. The first thing is <hi>the season</hi> of things, and that is of such use in the use of things, that as an Ancient Writer hath it, <hi>Quando tempus habet, bonum est ut sit, etiamsi bonum non est illud, quod bonum est ut sit,</hi> when it is in season, it is good that it should be, although that, which it is good that it should be, even be not good in it selfe. The other thing is the time of all things: for every thing under heaven hath but a time, and such a time as is also allotted to it. So that as the same Author speaketh, <hi>Omne quod est, aut aliud subsequitur, ut non ab initio veniat, aut praecurrit aliud ut usque ad finem se non extendat,</hi> Every thing that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goeth after another, so that it was not from the beginning, or else goeth before another, so that it doth not continue to the end. Now as the first teacheth, that nothing in his time is to be rejected, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not in his time is to bee embraced, so the other teacheth in such sort to use things in their time, as to see the vanity of them in that they have but a time. But as every thing hath its season, so one thing there is which hath every season, and that is the businesse of our salvation. Wherefore <hi>Nazianzene</hi> saith; Sow when the time is of sowing,<note place="margin">Nazianzene Orati. in S. Baptismo.</note> gather the fruits when the time is of gathering, &amp;c. <hi>At vero salutis tuae nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium semper age,</hi> But be alwayes doing the worke of thy salvation. And least this place might seeme to oppose it, which appointeth a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar season to every thing, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> noteth,<note place="margin">Ambros. in Psal. <hi>118.</hi>
                     </note> that it is spoken of every thing under heaven, <hi>Sed Dominus Iesus supra coelum est, nullo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptus tempore,</hi> but that the Lord Iesus is above the heavens not being circumscribed with any time. And surely it must be the care of every one so to use the things of this world in their time, which have but a time, <hi>Vt transeunte tempore sub coelo, succedat aeternitas quae est in coelo,</hi> That time passing away which is under heaven, eternity may succeed which is in heaven, as <hi>Hugo</hi> speaketh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 2. The Preacher here beginneth by diverse particulars to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:177008:38"/> shew, how as there is a fit time for the enjoying of worldly things, so the season is no lesse fit, which taketh them away: and putting these two seasons into the scales, he teacheth how the vanity and vexation of spirit in the parting with them, overweigheth the good that is found in the having of them.<note place="margin">Hugo de Sancto Vict. in Eccles. Homil. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> in the enumeration of these particulars, noteth severall things. As first hee noteth, that good and bad things are still joyned together: because such is the condition of this life, <hi>Et mixta sunt omnia, quamdiu tempus est, ut omnia habeant tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> and all things are mixed so long as there is time, that all things may have time. Secondly, he noteth that the Preacher beginneth with pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing good things before evill, and afterwards commeth to place evill things before good; because there are two lives to man, a carnall life, and a spirituall life,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.46.</note> and as the Apostle speaketh, first that which is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and them that which is spirituall. Now in the carnall life the good things goe before, the evill follow after: in the spirituall life the evill goe before, the good follow after. And therefore <hi>Hugo</hi> farther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that as the Preacher beginneth from good to evill, saying, <hi>There is a time to be borne, and a time to dye;</hi> so he endeth from evill to good, saying, <hi>A time of Warre, and a time of peace, Quia prima vita, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum, &amp; ultimùm malum: secunda vita primùm malum, &amp; ultimum bonum habet,</hi> Because the first life hath first good, and afterwards that which is evill, the second life, hath first evill and afterwards good. Thirdly, hee noteth how the Preacher confoundeth this order, and sometimes putteth good things first, sometimes evill, as shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the confusion that is in the world, <hi>Quia nec malis us{que} ad finem bona, nec bonis us{que} ad finem mala,</hi> Because neither the wicked have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes good things, nor the good have alwayes evill things. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us how the <hi>Iewes</hi> doe apply all these to the people of <hi>Israel.</hi>

                     </note> to that religious care, whereby <hi>Nobis ipsis quodammodo patres sumus,</hi> wee are as it were fathers to our selves, and doe bring our selves forth to bee children unto God: <hi>the time of dying,</hi> to a religious mortification of our selves, whereby a man, <hi>Nunquam sibi vivit, sed viventem in seipso habet Christum,</hi> doth never live to himselfe, but hath Christ living in him. But in a literall sense the words import two things, first that as there is a <hi>time of being borne, so there is a time of dying.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexand. Stro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum l. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> For as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> reporteth, <hi>Solome</hi> asking our Saviour Christ how long death should have power, the answer which our Saviour gave, was, so long as you women bring forth. For as he addeth, <hi>Ortum omnino se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur interitus,</hi> Dying is sure to follow after being borne. The other thing which the words import is, that there <hi>is a fit time for being borne,</hi> namely when the season appointed by nature is accomplished, those that come before being abortives: and that <hi>there is a fit time of dying,</hi> namely when the period set by nature is come, those that dye before suffering a violent death. Wherefore a Greeke Father saith, <hi>Venit tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus &amp; natus sum; veniet tempus &amp; moriar,</hi> The time came, and I was borne, the time shall come, and I shall dye. The last part of the verse, sheweth the same in things of a vegetable life, which was shewed in things of a sensitive life: or else sheweth the same in things that are brought forth by art and industry, which was shewed in things brought forth by nature. In a spirituall sense we know who is our husbandman: wee know whose husbandry we are; the one we have from our Saviour Christ, the other from St. <hi>Paul</hi> the servant of Christ.<note place="margin">

Or if we will apply the words to our selves, there is a time <hi>to plant</hi> those vertues in our soules which are not growing in them, and there is a time <hi>to plucke up</hi> the weeds of vice which grow too fast in them. A time must be allotted unto both; and a fit time ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken will make the worke both the more easie, and the more successefull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 3. The Preacher in the former Verse having placed good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evill; in this verse he placeth the evill before the good: for so it is in the things of this world, <hi>Subsequuntur quae praecesserant, &amp; rursus quae sequuta fuerunt praecedunt,</hi> Those things follow which went before, and those things goe before which followed. The verse we may consider in a threefold sense, either literall, morall, or spirituall. As for the first, the Preacher having spoken of the vanity of man, in his being and not being, from thence hee goeth on to shew the vanity of those things
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:177008:39"/> which serve for the preservation of his being; and having shewed it in plants, here hee sheweth it first in beasts, which in their fit time and when they are fit food for man, <hi>are killed</hi> for his use, and which at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time are kept alive and cherished, and so are as it were <hi>healed,</hi> that they may bee made fit for mans nourishment. Now as <hi>Cicero</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> speaketh, <hi>Quotidie mori docemur, qui mortuis nutrimur,</hi> We are continually taught to dye, who doe live by those things which are made to dye for us; so the Preacher doth farther shew man his vanity, by the perishing of those things which for his sake are subject to vanity. Secondly, the Preacher having spoken of the inward meanes which serve for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of mans being, he speaketh also of the outward meanes, as of houses and buildings, and which as in time growing old, have a fit time to be <hi>broken downe;</hi> so when they <hi>are built in</hi> their time, have but a time of standing though built never so strongly. Much hath beene the labour, and great the cost of men, <hi>Vt starent post ipsos monumenta jactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae illorum, &amp; invaluerunt us{que} ad aliquid,</hi> That the monuments of their vaine glory might stand after them, and something they have done, as one speaketh: but what a vaine pleasure is this, that their buildings stand upon the earth, when themselves are fallen into the earth? And what though their buildings outstand them? They cannot stand out against time, which will have a fit time to throw them down. And in this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall sense wee may marke, that the Preacher saying, in the former verse, A time to plucke up, that which is planted, hee doth not here speake in the same manner; because that which is killed, is not healed, but another; that which is pulled downe is not built up, but another. In a morall sense we may understand the verse thus: that justice hath a fit time of <hi>killing,</hi> where expectation of amendment is already killed; and mercy hath a fit time of <hi>healing</hi> by forgiving, where hope of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good by it giveth vertue and force to the medicine: justice hath a time of <hi>breaking downe</hi> by due punishment where it is needfull, and of <hi>building up</hi> by rewarding the well doers for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: justice hath a time of <hi>killing</hi> and destroying where wrong is done, and of <hi>healing</hi> and building up, where wrong is suffered. Lastly, in a spirituall sense,<note place="margin">Greg. Nyss. in Eccles. Homil. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> telleth us, that there is a time of <hi>killing, Malam animi motuum aciem, &amp; hoc civile quod in nos per voluptates geri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur bellum, &amp; nos captivos reddit legi peccati,</hi> That hurtfull army of the affections of the minde, and that civill warre which pleasures make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, and which doth make us captive unto the law of sinne: and there is a time of <hi>healing</hi> the wounds which they have given us. There is a time of <hi>breaking downe</hi> the strong holds of sinne, and there is a time of <hi>building up</hi> the Temple of God in our selves. And here we may note the order that is used: first there must be a <hi>killing</hi> before there can be <hi>a healing:</hi> first there must bee <hi>a breaking downe,</hi> before there can bee a <hi>building up.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jerem.</hi> 1.10.</note> In the commission of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> the same order is observed: where God saith, I have set thee this day, to roote out and to pull downe, to build and to plant. The straw and the stubble that is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:177008:39"/> in us must first be taken away, before that we can build silver and gold, and pretious stones. For as a Greeke Father speaketh, <hi>Fieri non potest ut cum stipula coalescat argentum, vel foeno agglutinetur aurum, vel ligno margaritum,</hi> It cannot be that silver should agree with stubble, or gold be joyned with straw, or a Pearle with wood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 4. The Preacher passeth from man considered in his owne being, and from those things that doe preserve him in his being, to other things that doe belong to them. And therefore <hi>Lyra</hi> briefly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this verse saith, that there is a time to <hi>weepe, in infortuniis</hi> in the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of this life, and a time <hi>to laugh, in eufortuniis</hi> in the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of it: that there is a time to <hi>mourne in funeribus defunctorum</hi> in the funerals of the dead, and a time to <hi>dance, in nuptiis conjugatorum</hi> at the bridals of the maryed. But to marke the words a little more narrowly, The latter part of the verse, is but <hi>velut repetitio ejus quod prius dictum est,</hi> As it were a repetition of that which is before spoken,<note place="margin">Gregor. Nis. in Ecclesiast. Homil. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> saith <hi>Gregory Nyssene.</hi> Only saith he, it addeth some amplification unto it. For as by <hi>dancing</hi> is signified a greater measure of rejoycing, so <hi>planctu, by mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> the Scripture useth to expresse a greater measure of sorrowing. But <hi>Hugo</hi> farther noteth, that <hi>Fletus &amp; risus ad animum pertinent, planctus &amp; saltatio ad corpus,</hi> weeping and laughing doe belong to the minde,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. in Eccles. Hom. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> mourning and dancing to the body. And indeed the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which is here used for mourning signifieth the outward cariage of the body in sorrow. Wherefore saith he, in the first place are set downe the joy and sorrow of the mind: by mourning and dancing in the second place the same things are signified, but as they are shewed in the motions of the body. For as a Greeke Father saith, <hi>vulnerum ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi tanquam sanguis lachrymae sunt,</hi> Teares are as it were the bloud of the wounds of the soule, which manifest the greatnesse of them, and so the light skipping of the body in dancing, is but a shadow of the light and lofty flying of the mind in joy. Now God hath blended these two in mans life for many reasons: but I will mention two only. The first is to distinguish this life from the next. For in the next life, either in heaven there will bee nothing but joy; or else in hell nothing but howling. If in this life there should bee nothing but joy, many would looke for no other heaven: if now there should be nothing but sorrow, many might seeme to bee in hell before they come unto it. This life therefore which is the way to either, partaketh of both. Secondly, God hath mixed joy with sorrow in this life, thereby to keepe us in the right way. For if we should have nothing but joy, we should be quickly too much puffed up: if nothing but sorrow, wee should bee easily too much cast downe. But these being mixed, the sorrowes of this world doe weane our affections from the vanities of it: the joyes of this life do make us long for the greater joyes of the next. Now seeing there is in this life a fit time for both, <hi>Per haec discimus, quod ad rem praesentem opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teat etiam animum accommodare. Prospere res succedunt? Tempestivum est lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari: reducta est animi alacritas ad demissionem? converti etiam convenit
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:177008:40"/> in lachrymas,</hi> By this wee learne, that we must apply our minds to the present occasion. Doe things succeed happily? It is a fit time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. Is the cheerefulnesse of our mind humbled? It is meete then that our singing bee turned into weeping, as the same Father speaketh. But more generally Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, and out of him the ordinary Glosse.<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Nunc tempus flendi est, &amp; in futuro ridendi: Beatienim flentes, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam ipsi ridebunt,</hi> Now is the time of weeping, hereafter of laughing. For as our Saviour saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.21.</note>
                     <hi>Blessed are yee that weepe now, for ye shall laugh.</hi> And <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> also shewing this life to be the time of mourning, in which there is so much cause of mourning,<note place="margin">Greg. Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. in Eccles. Homil. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> thereupon saith, <hi>Omnia primas tenent in malorum excellentia, omnia parem praebent luctus occasionem,</hi> All things have the precedency in the excellency of evils, all things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford like matter of griefe: So that for which to lament most it is hard to find.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 5. It is not easie to enter into these stones, and to discerne what is meant by them. An Ancient Writer taking them for men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the casting away of stones to be casting of men into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the gathering of stones to bee the recalling of them into their owne Countries and places.<note place="margin">Gregor. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alog. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>37</hi> prope finem.</note> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the great taking them for good men, and reading the words <hi>tempus mittendi lapides,</hi> a time of sending stones, applyeth them to God, who in his good time sendeth good men into the world for a blessing to it, and in his time gathereth them out of the world to deliver them from the evils of it. But that which I conceive to be the right veine, for finding the meaning of the stones,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> is that which <hi>Lyra</hi> hath, who by stones here understandeth <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilicia,</hi> fortresses, as being anciently for their strength made of stone; and which have a time, when though never so strong they are demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and their stones cast away: as on the other side, there was a time which served fitly for gathering the stones together, and for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them. A Greek Father taketh these stones for stones of Warre, but applying them in a spirituall manner hee saith, <hi>Est omnino intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, quod quae vitium perimunt cogitationes, eae sunt lapides, qui ab Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siaste fundâ recte jaciuntur, quos semper mitti oportet &amp; colligi. Mitti quidem ad eum evertendum, qui contra vitam nostram erigitur: colligi autem ad hoc ut animae nostrae sinus plenus sit iis praeparatis, ut ad manum sit quod jaci possit in adversarios,</hi> It is absolutely to be understood, that the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which destroy vice are the stones which by the Preacher are rightly cast from the sling, which it is needfull alwayes to bee cast out, and alwayes to be gathered: to be cast out for the overthrowing of him, who riseth up against us; to be gathered for this end, that the bosome of our soule, may bee filled with them in readinesse, and may have at hand that which may bee throwne against the adversaries. Of these stones hee saith, <hi>Est adeo pulcher jactus, ut &amp; hostem interimant, et ab ejus qui jacit manu non separantur,</hi> The casting is so excellent, that they both kill the enemy, and are not put away from his hand that throweth them. The latter part of the verse I would also understand as pertaining
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:177008:40"/> to the same sense with the former, because in this passage of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, it is generally so set downe by him. And then by <hi>embracing,</hi> I should conceive the embracing of safetie and defence in strong For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses: according as I finde the word used in <hi>Iob,</hi> where it is sayd, They embrace the rocke for want of a shelter.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 24.8.</note> Now there is a fit time when fortresses doe serve for defence; and there is a fit time which sheweth the vanitie of them, and when he that flyeth unto them, is farre from embracing safetie and defence by them. The literall mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the words present to the first view, is to understand them of those embracings which God hath ordained for the continuance of mankinde upon the earth. For as there is a time in which this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing is to be used, <hi>Vt reparetur mortalitas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. in Ecclesiast. Homil. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>et excipiatur mortalium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitas,</hi> that mortalitie may be repayred, and the infirmitie of mortall men may be sustained, as <hi>Hugo</hi> speaketh: so there is a time in which it is good to refraine from this embracing: and that is especially in the time of Gods wrath and visitation. The ancient Fathers doe very much note the manner of <hi>Noahs</hi> going into the Arke, and how the Father and the sonnes went together, the Mother and her daughters in law went together: God himselfe dividing at that time those whom himselfe had joyned together. Whereupon S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Ambros. l. de Noe &amp; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. c. <hi>21.</hi>

                     <hi>Aperte et velut or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ipso ingressionis, vocem quandam justus emittit, tempus illud non esse delitiarum, quo omnibus imminet interitus: quam enim indecorum, ut quo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore viventes morerentur, eo morituri generarentur?</hi> Plainely, and as it were by the order it selfe of their going in, the righteous man pronounceth, that, not to be a time of delights in which destruction hangeth over all: for how unseemely is it, that at what time the living dye, at the same time they should be begotten who are to dye. Notwithstanding Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> conceiveth, that <hi>Cham</hi> even in the Arke did neglect this care: and this he gathereth from Scripture,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Genes. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. <hi>28.</hi>
                     </note> because when they came out of the Arke, it is sayd, and the sonnes of <hi>Noah</hi> went forth of the Arke, <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Ham</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> and <hi>Ham</hi> is the Father of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceived in the Arke, and borne not long after their comming out.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 6. Man having deprived himselfe of those true good things wherein he was created, seeketh now after those things, <hi>In quibus est ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re aliquid ad bonum, sed non vera bona,</hi> in which there is truely something that may serve for good, but they are not truely good things, as one speaketh. And these God, <hi>In tempore suo nunc tribuit acquirenda, nunc acquisita subtrahit,</hi> now giveth to be gotten, now taketh away being gotten, that man may both see the vaine contentment of them when he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:177008:41"/> hath gotten them, and the great vanitie of them when they are lost. The Preacher therefore passing from the things belonging to man, to the using of them by man, here he speaketh of <hi>getting, loosing, keeping, and casting them away.</hi> The Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> for the most part is translated by Interpreters to <hi>get,</hi> and the reason I suppose to be, because the next words speake of loosing: but the signification of the word is to seeke, and it may be that the Preacher doth use this word here, to shew that all which man can attaine unto, is but a seeking of the things of this world, for there is no true getting of those things which are to be lost againe. And therefore as an ancient writer hath it, <hi>Agnoscat ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, quod omnia quae invito tolli poterant fuerant, etiam quum possidebantur, extranea,</hi> Let man acknowledge, that all things which can be taken from a man against his will, even then when they were possessed, were not his owne. Yea they are not onely such things which may be and are taken away, but such as himselfe also must <hi>cast away.</hi> For as there is a fit time of keeping them, so there is of casting them away: because as the same Authour speaketh,<note place="margin">Ibid.

Which therefore that we may doe, wee were best at all times to cast them away from the love of our hearts. <hi>Gregory Nyssene,</hi>

                     </note> who readeth the first part of this verse, <hi>Tempus est quaerendi,</hi> there is a time to seeke, applyeth it to the seeking of God, <hi>Cujus inventio est ipsum semper quaerere,</hi> The finding of whom is alwayes to seeke him. For as he addeth, <hi>Non est aliud quaerere, &amp; aliud invenire, sed acquirendi lucrum est ipsum quaerere,</hi> It is not one thing to seeke and another thing to finde, but the gaine of finding is the seeking it selfe. Now the time of seeking God, he tels us briefly, is, the whole life of man. For as he addeth farther, <hi>In hoc solo, studii tempus est totum studium,</hi> In this thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the time of seeking is the whole seeking of man. The <hi>loosing</hi> here mentioned he applyeth to the loosing of sinne, <hi>Cujus amissio est lucrum,</hi> whose loosing is indeed a gaining. Wherefore he sayth, <hi>Mala possessio est avaritia, perdamus eam: malum depositum est acceptae injuriae recordatio, id aemittamus,</hi> Covetousnesse is an ill possession, let us loose it: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of a wrong received is a thing ill layd up, let us let it goe; for the loosing of that must needs be a gaine, which being kept breedeth losse. He expounding also the latter part of the verse, sayth, <hi>Quid ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandi? Id scilicet quod a nobis inventum est ex inquisitione. Quid ejiciendi? Id scilicet cujus amissionem existimatum est conferre,</hi> There is a time to keepe, what?

There is a time to cast away, what? namely that, the loosing whereof is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit unto us; and that being sinne, let us by repentance so cast it away, that wee never take it againe: for it is the casting away of that, that keepeth God with us.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The condition of mans life taketh often much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the sowing together of a friendly societie, and where it is done in a fit time, how sweet is it? But the vanitie of this appeareth in that the renting also of societie is that which is needfull also to have content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which hath a fit time in which it must be done. Wherefore <hi>Hugo</hi> sayth, <hi>Habet consutionem suam tempore suo consensus socialis;</hi>

                     <hi>habet &amp; scissionem suam in tempore suo zelus justae contradictionis,</hi> A sociable agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath in its time his sowing together, and the zeale of a just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction hath in his time his renting also. Answerably to this I take the latter part of the verse to speake of a sociable conferring and talking together, wherein the minde of man is much delighted, and when it is done in a fit time, how pleasant is it? But yet the vanitie of it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, in that the minde of man being wearyed with its owne content, silence is desired in the place of it, and hath a fit time that makes it most agreeable. This I conceive to be the most naturall meaning of the place. But if we shall take <hi>the time of silence and speaking</hi> in a generall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, then wee may first note, that silence goeth before speaking, and therefore as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> sayth, <hi>Discamus prius non loqui,</hi>

Now to understand the former part of the verse in the same kinde; there is a time of <hi>renting,</hi> a time of renting open the lips, when undue
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:177008:42"/> feare of displeasing, or unjust bribing, or sloathfull negligence, may hold them hard together: and there is a time of <hi>sowing</hi> up the lips, when choler, or rashnesse, or provoking speeches doe strive to open them too speedily.

                     </note> that as the same Father speaketh, <hi>Ad se reducti tanto libentius ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortationis verba recipiunt, quanto se tranquillius toleratos erubescunt,</hi> That being brought unto themselves, they doe the more willingly receive the words of exhortation, by how much the more quietly they have been borne with, being ashamed of it. But to consider the words also in a more spirituall sense; There is a time of <hi>renting</hi> our selves from the devill, and of breaking from his snares and bonds: and there is a time of uniting also, and as it were <hi>sowing</hi> our selves to God, and of fastning our hearts to his commandements,<note place="margin">Greg.

                     <hi>Vt ab illo abrupti cui male adhaesimus, illi adhaereamus, cui bonum est adhaerere,</hi> That being rent from him to whom we have stuck perniciously, we may stick to him, to whom it is good to sticke, as <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> speaketh.

                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.27.</note> So surely it is good for all to cleave fast to him. According to this application of the first part of the verse, <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> applyeth also the latter part, saying, That there is a time of <hi>keeping silence,</hi> when we thinke of God, whose glory cannot be expressed: and there is a time to speake, namely, of such things, which concerne our dutie towards God and man, and may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease vertue in our selves and others. An ancient writer doth hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely apply the first part of the verse in a spirituall sense, and manner, to the flesh and the spirit: to the flesh, the renting, for being made one with it by living according to the flesh, we must rent our selves from it: to the Spirit, the sowing, because by living godly it must be our care to be joyned to him. Neither (sayth he) is this to be omitted, that the things which are rent asunder are substantially one; but the things which are sowne together are substantially diverse, being as it were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally made one, by something that tyes them. For so indeed man by his corrupted nature is made one with the corruption of the flesh; but he is united to spirituall things by the bond of grace. In this sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore to the Spirit, the needle is compunction, the threed is love. The needle maketh way and goeth through both, that so the thread may hold both together. First then, the needle of compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on goeth through the things of the flesh, when it considereth our sinnes, it goeth through the things of the Spirit, when it considereth the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God: it goeth through humane things, when it considereth our duties towards God; it goeth through spirituall things, when it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:177008:42"/> his gracious promises towards us. Then followeth the thread of love, for the sight of Gods gracious promises in his mercy, maketh us to love him, and God seeing our sorrow and repentance, he is in love reconciled to us, and so wee are happily fast tyed the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 8. Time is a circle, and the Preacher shutteth up this passage of time in a circle: For having begunne with a time to be borne, and a time to dye: he endeth with a time of warre, which is a time of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with a time of peace, which is a time wherein people by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth are multiplyed. But first to consider the first part of the verse, A Greeke Father defineth love and hatred thus: <hi>Amor est intrinsecus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sita in id quod animo est jucundum, habitudo operans per voluptatem. Odium est alienatio ab eo quod est injucundum, et aversio ab <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o quod molestiâ afficit,</hi> Love is an inward seated inclination to that which is sweet to the mind working by pleasure and delight. Hatred is an alienation from that which is unpleasing, and a turning away from that which breedeth trouble. But how great soever the pleasure may be of enjoying that which is loved, how great soever the contentment may be in shunning that which is hated, yet let no man set his heart upon them. For great is the vanitie of them: seeing the same things, <hi>Quae sunt odio habita pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sint iterum juste diligi, et dilecta rursum juste odio haberi,</hi> which are accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy of hatred, may againe justly be loved, and those things which are loved, may againe justly be hated, as one speaketh. There is sayth the Preacher, <hi>a time to love, and a time to hate:</hi> yea fit time for both. And therefore S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaking of these words sayth,<note place="margin">Ambros. in Psal. <hi>118.</hi> Octon. <hi>14.</hi>

Is it not to shew us, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the difference of time, wee may both hate and love: and that it may be fitting to hate those whom thou lovest, and to love those whom hatest? While the time is, what love is sweeter then the love of a wife, who is as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh, <hi>Quaedam vitae cohaeres,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> a kinde of coheire of the life of man? While the time is, what love is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing then the love of a brother, who as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> also speaketh,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>Eodem formatur naturae hospitio,</hi> Is formed in the same lodging of nature?

Vnto the times of love and hatred, agree the times of warre and peace: the times of hatred being times of warre, the times of love, being times of peace.

Wherefore discretion is needfull, and the time of hatred and love is set downe, that we may goe in a right course, <hi>Neque suffocemus naturam, dum culpam persequimur, neque culpam nutria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, quando naturam fovemus,</hi> and may neither overthrow nature while we suppresse sinne; neither yet nourish vice, while we cherish nature, as one speaketh: But because this cannot be done without great stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, much fighting, therefore it is added, <hi>a time of warre, and a time of peace, Vt simul agnoscat homo, et quod nemo sine pugna ad victoriam pervenit, et quod qui legitime certaverit, post adeptam victoriam in pace requiescet,</hi> That so a man may acknowledge, as well that no one obtaineth victory without fighting, as also that he who fighteth law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, after the victory obtained, resteth in peace, as the same Father addeth.</p>

                     </note> It is the wish of <hi>Hugo</hi> by occasion of this passage of the Preacher, <hi>Modo de temporibus exivimus, sed utinam pervenissemus ad aeternitatem,</hi> wee have passed over the times, but I would to God, wee were come to eternity. And God grant that we may so passe the times of this life, that in his good time wee may come to eternall life. A Greeke Father maketh this verse, to be the speech of conscience, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the soule of man, when this life is ended. Then conscience saith, Where are thy stately houses? Where are thy stuffed bagges? Thy brazen statues, the applause of thy flatterers? <hi>What profit hath he that worketh, in that wherein he laboureth?</hi> But though the words doe fit the mouth of conscience, the application doth not fit the meaning of the place. The Preacher having shewed in the vanities of time, the succession of evill after good, the precedency of evill before good, the mixture of evill with good, the fitnesse of time for both, and therein the vanity of the things of this world, though being enjoyed in their time, there may be some good in the enjoying of them: here he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that it is not all mans working, all his labour that can help this. He cannot effect that the time of dying, should not follow the time of being borne: hee cannot bring it to passe, that a time of weeping should not goe before a time of laughing. He cannot prevaile, that a time of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and loosing should not be mixed together. <hi>The profit of all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> is not the redressing of this vanity in things. All his <hi>working</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find a fit time to remedy these fit times of changing, and wherein the vexation of mans spirit is established. The Hebrew therefore that was Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi> Master in expounding the Scriptures unto him,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> did right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expound to him the meaning of this verse, <hi>Quum omnia suo labantur tempore, &amp; sit tempus destruendi &amp; aedificandi, flendi &amp; ridendi, &amp;c. Quid frustra conamur &amp; tendimus, &amp; brevis vitae labores putamus esse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuos?</hi> Seeing that all things doe passe away in their time, and that there is a time of breaking downe, and of building up, a time of weeping and a time of laughing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why doe we in vaine worke, and labour, and thinke to make the workes of our short life to be of long continuance? For as Saint <hi>Basil</hi> bringing in <hi>Iob</hi> comforting his Wife in their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties maketh him to say, <hi>Semper prospere agere solius est Dei:</hi>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 10. The Preachers <hi>Vidi</hi> here, I have seene, is nothing else but an affirmation of that which he saith. For when we see a thing, the eye doth as it were say, that this is such a thing, so the Preacher saying, <hi>I have seene the travell,</hi> it is as if he said, This is the travell, this, that all things in this world have a contrariety of times; this, that man must be subject to these times, and cannot by all his labour and working free himselfe from it. This is that which <hi>God hath given,</hi> that is, this is that which God hath appointed and ordained, and which man cannot alter. For as an Ancient Writer speaketh, <hi>Omnia nutum sequuntur dispositio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis aeternae, ne{que} arbitrio humano subduntur,</hi> All things doe follow the becke of the supernaturall disposing, neither are the changes of times subject to mans arbitrement. This therefore God hath given, God hath appointed <hi>to the sonnes of men,</hi> that is, to all generations, to all succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of men.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 11. That any thing is made in his time, is enough to make it beautifull. For as <hi>Hugo Victorinus</hi> speaketh, <hi>Omnia tempus habent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hugo Ʋicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus in Ecclesiast. Homil. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>qùia in tempore suo omnia bene fieri habent, &amp; bona sunt, quum bene fiunt omnia,</hi> There is a time to all things, because in their time all things are well done, and all things that are well done, are good being done. But when God who is the disposer of time, and the beauty of holinesse, maketh any thing in his time, it must needs be beautifull. Notwithstanding the vaine heart of man, is too apt to blame the things which God hath made. A time of laughing hee liketh, but not a time of weeping, a time of dancing, but not a time of mourning. <hi>Et quum bene fit, &amp; ipse male non vult, dicit male fieri, quum bene fiat, &amp; ipse male velit,</hi> And when a thing is well done, but his evill will would not have it to be done, he saith, that it is ill done, but the thing is well done, and it is his will that is evill, as one speaketh. Now the reason why man is so ready to blame the workes of God, is, <hi>because the world is in his heart,</hi> and God is said <hi>to have set it there,</hi> because he hath permitted the world to be there. The love then of the world that is in mans heart, makes him to desire that all things in the world should prosper alway. He is pleased with a building up, but displeased to heare of a breaking downe: he is well contented with planting, but discontented to heare of plucking up. So that being blinded with this love, <hi>he cannot find out,</hi> the wise causes from which they doe proceed, which is <hi>the beginning of them:</hi> he cannot find out the good uses to which they are ordained, which is <hi>the end of them.</hi> That which our translation readeth, <hi>He hath set the world in their heart,</hi> the Septuagint and according to them the Vulgar Latin render, <hi>Et mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum tradidit disputationibus eorum,</hi> and hee hath delivered the world to their disputation. For as an Ancient Writer saith, <hi>Proposuit Deus opus su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in oculis hominum, ut interrogaret corda ipsorum de eo,</hi> God hath set his worke in the eyes of men, that hee might aske their hearts of it. And many are the answers which mens hearts have given, or rather <hi>multa fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brefacta mendacia opinionum de judicio rerum,</hi> many lyes of opinions ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially made of the judgement of things. <hi>Aliqui asserunt nihil esse, nisi ipsum quod videtur, alii quod nihil est vere, nisi ipsum quod non videtur,</hi> Some affirme, that nothing is, but that only which is seene: others, that nothing truly is, but that onely which is not seene. <hi>Et texunt rationes, &amp; quasi rationes, &amp; est cui{que} ratio existimatio sua,</hi> And they frame reasons, and as it were reasons, and every ones opinion is to him a reason. But the booke which God hath given man to study, consisteth of two vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, the one containeth the workes that he hath made, the other his providence over his workes: the one is larger, the other hath more hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and abstruse matter: the one is read by more, the other by them who
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:177008:45"/> are more excellent, the one is understood by sharpnesse of reason, the other by the illumination of Gods Holy Spirit. For God hath made it darke, and God hath done this to this end, that man not being able to find out the worke of God, he might seeke to God, because unlesse God reveale it, man cannot know it. Or if man by the light of nature bee able to find out some of Gods workes, yet he cannot find out his work from the <hi>beginning to the end.</hi> Hee cannot find out the <hi>beginning</hi> of it, how God made all things by his word of nothing: he cannot find out <hi>the end</hi> of it, <hi>Si enim ad finem pervenire potuisset, invenisset uti{que} Deum: quoniam a quo sunt, ibi finem habent omnia.</hi> For if he could have come to the end, he would have come to God, because from whom all things are, there they have their end.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 12. The Preacher having shewed, that no one can know the times of Gods workes, Yet saith he, this <hi>I know,</hi> this I will take upon me to tell, that <hi>there is no good in them,</hi> that is, howsoever good, howsoever beautifull they may be in themselves and in the seasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of them, which are things that God maketh; yet there is in them no good for man, there is no other good which man is to doe in them, <hi>then to rejoyce, and to doe good in his life:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Glossa minor.</note> as the lesser Glosse doth well expound it, <hi>Frui praesentibus, &amp; facere quod in futuro prosit to enioy</hi> the present things, and to doe that which may bee profitable in the time to come. The Originall here is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>in vitis suis,</hi> in his lives, and though it be an Hebraisme, yet by occasion of it, wee may note the two lives of man, either his life in prosperity, or else his life in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity. And surely that which is good for man, is to rejoyce in both, is to doe good in both. And therefore when our Saviour Christ speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of sad times saith, when these things begin to come to passe,<note place="margin">Luk. <hi>21.28.</hi> Galfridus, apud Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannum.</note> then looke up, and lift up your heads; thereupon <hi>Galfridus</hi> saith, <hi>Dimitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in prosperis capita, ne vanitatis aura nos rapiat, Levemus in adversis capita, ne nos torrentis mergat unda,</hi> Let us hold downe our heads in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity least the ayre of vanity cary us away; in adversity let us lift up our heads, that the water of the torrent doe not drowne us. And in the times of adversity, let us doe good by setting forth the good example of our patience, and by doing good to them who have beene the causes of our evils. But if it be the good of man to rejoyce in times of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and to do good in them, then much more in the times of prosperity. When God sendeth man good things, let him with moderation, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, thankfulnesse take the comfort of them. For what is more wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, then as <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaketh, <hi>Parare opes tanquam splendidos,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plutarch. l. de Cupid. Divitiarum.</note>
                     <hi>uti tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam sordidos,</hi> To get the good things of this life as men that are in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, to use them as men that are in misery? What is more unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, then as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh, <hi>Suis abstinere tanquam alienis,</hi> To abstaine from a mans owne things, as if they were the things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man? And indeed as the same Father goeth on,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Homil. <hi>2.</hi> ad Popul.</note> What are the things that such a one hath, but the things of another rather than his owne? <hi>Quae enim ne{que} aliis erogare, ne{que} in necessariis impendere audet, licet multas sustineret poenas, quomodo propria sunt?</hi> For how are those things
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:177008:46"/> his owne, which he dareth not although he suffer much by it, either to extend unto others in charity, or else to expend upon his owne necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occasions. But as a man must rejoyce and doe good to himselfe in times of prosperity, so must he doe it to others, by making them also to rejoyce through a partaking with him in the good, which God hath sent him. In generall, it must bee the care of every man in all times, to feare God, for that is the good of man, that it is which maketh all times to be good to man. And therefore hath God hidden, the times of his workes from man, <hi>Vt dum nec pro nostro intellectu penetrare, nec pro nostro arbitrio immutare possimus, amplius timeamus,</hi> That seeing wee are not able either by our understanding to pierce into them, or according to our minds to alter them, therefore we should feare him the more, as an Ancient Writer speaketh. Had it beene said onely, it is good for a man to rejoyce, it would have beene entertained readily. But it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also, that we must doe good: and surely that alone is true rejoycing, that alone it is which maketh all joy to be comfortable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 13. It is not the gift of God to man, to know the times of things: that God hath reserved to himselfe: but <hi>that every man should eate and drinke,</hi> that is, that every man should enjoy health, and thereby enjoy the good of his labour, <hi>that is his gift unto them.</hi> For as the Poet speaketh,<note place="margin">Horatius.</note>
                     <hi>Valeat possessor oportet, Si comportatis rebus bene cogitat uti,</hi> Hee that hath gathered much together, if he thinke to enjoy it, it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that he should enjoy health. And that he may enjoy health, it must be the gift of God unto him. Wherefore when <hi>Iacob</hi> saith, The God which fed me all my life unto this day,<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>48.15.</hi> &amp; <hi>16.</hi> Philo Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legoriar. l. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> the Angell which redeemed me from all evill, blesse the laddes: it is the note of <hi>Philo</hi> upon it, <hi>Sanita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem meram, quam nullus morbus praecessit, Deum per semet solum largiri opinor, liberationem autem à morbo etiam per artem &amp; medicinam,</hi> I thinke that God doth give by himselfe alone, that which is meerely health, and hath not had any sicknesse going before it: but as for recovery from sicknesse, that he giveth also by art and the skill of the Physitian. And hee thinketh that <hi>Iacob</hi> did here speake in this manner, as reproving <hi>Ioseph</hi> because hee had before sent a message unto him by his brethren,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.</note> saying, <hi>Come downe unto me into Aegypt, and there I will nourish thee.</hi> The Father therefore seeing his sonne to be his mothers child in her infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that as she ascribed too much to the Creature, saying, <hi>Give mee children,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.1.</note>
                     <hi>or else I dye,</hi> so did he likewise, saying, <hi>I will nourish thee,</hi> this made him to tell his son, that it is God who doth feed us, it is Gods gift unto us, that we eate and drinke, and so enjoy health. And it is Gods gift that every man <hi>enjoyeth the good of all his labour.</hi> Where wee may first note, that it is upon labour that Gods gift is bestowed. For Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> writing on those words of our Saviour Christ, many Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were in <hi>Israel</hi> in the time of <hi>Elisaeus</hi> the Prophet, and none of them was cleansed saving <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> there telleth us, <hi>evidenter hic sermo Domini informat nos,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambrose in c. <hi>4.</hi> Lucae.</note>
                     <hi>non dormientibus divina beneficia, sed observanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus deferri,</hi> This speech of Christ doth manifestly teach us, the benefits
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:177008:46"/> of God to be bestowed not on them that sleepe, but on them who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to doe what God requireth of them. Secondly, wee may note here, that Gods gift maketh man to enjoy the good of <hi>all</hi> his labour, not onely the good of his comfortable labour, but of his miserable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour also. And as an ancient Writer speaketh, <hi>Non solum quando bonis hujus mundi industriâ suâ acquisitis cum gratiarum actione perfruitur; sed tunc etiam, quando in adversis constitutus pro patientiae suae labore spe futurae consolationis laetatur,</hi> Not onely when he enjoyeth with thankfulnesse the good things of this world, which by his labour he hath gotten, but even then also when placed in adversitie, he rejoyceth in the hope of future consolation, as a reward for the labour of his patience. The evill that is in any of mans labour, that is, his own gift to himselfe: but the good of it, that is Gods gift. For indeed evill cannot come from God. And therefore when <hi>Saul</hi> came into the cave where <hi>David</hi> was,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.4.</note> and <hi>Davids</hi> men sayd unto him, Behold the day, of which the Lord sayd unto thee, behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand: This mentioning of the Lord could not make <hi>David</hi> to hurt <hi>Saul:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Basil</hi> noteth upon it; <hi>Hominis interemptio,</hi>

But not to speake more of this:<note place="margin">Salvian. de Guber. Dei. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> So foolish are these and such like objections, that as <hi>Salvianus</hi> speaketh, <hi>Cavendum est, quod ne id ipsum quod pro honore Dei dicitur, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria Dei esse videatur. Tanta quippe est Majestatis sacrae &amp; tam tremenda re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verentia, ut non solum ea quae ab illis contra religionem dicuntur horrere, sed aliam quae pro religione nos ipsi dicimus, cum grandi metu &amp; disciplina dicere debeamus,</hi> Care must be had, least that every thing which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the honour of God, may seeme to be an injury unto him. For so great and so fearefull is the reverence due to the Divine Majestie, that wee ought not onely to abhorre those things which are spoken against Religion, but also with feare and awfulnesse to speake those things, which wee our selves speake for Religion. Let it suffice therefore, as the Preacher sayth, <hi>That whatsoever God doth, it shall abide for ever.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 15. It is true, that Gods preservation of all things in the world, in their kindes and natures, though they be passed away and changed, in their particular beings, and individuall existences, doth make that to be now, which hath been before, and that which is to be, to have been already, and God to recall that as it were which is driven away and past, and so the worke of God to abide continually. But I take the Preacher more especially to speake of the workes of Gods providence, and to shew how they are immutable, and doe abide for ever, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fluctuation and inconstancy of worldly things. He tels us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here, that with God there is no difference of times to him, that which <hi>hath been</hi> is now, and it is all one with him <hi>to be hereafter, and to have been already.</hi> He asketh that (for so the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> may well be rendred) <hi>which is gone</hi> he speaketh to it, as if it were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. For as the Apostle speaketh,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17.</note> He calleth those things which are not, as if they were. And as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Austin</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Augustinus.</note>
                     <hi>Non aliter scivit Deus crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta quam creanda,</hi> God did not know things otherwise when they were created, then he did when they were to be created. But as <hi>Boetius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Boetius.</note> hath it, <hi>Omnia futura praecurrit divinus intuitus, &amp; ad praesentiam revocat, uno{que} ictu simul complectitur,</hi> The sight of divine providence outgoeth all future things, and making them to be present, at once doth comprehend them. Wherefore when wee speake of things past, present, and to come, this is not to be understood in respect of God, <hi>Sed rerum quae fiunt, &amp; nostri quibus patefiunt,</hi> but in respect of the things which are made, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of us to whom they are made knowne. And therefore the manner of speaking in the Scripture, is not that God foreknoweth future things, but that he knoweth them as being present to him. So in S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Iohns</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel it is sayd of <hi>Christ, that he knew all things that should come unto him.</hi>

                     <hi>I know that the King of Aegypt will not let you goe.</hi> For so according to the Originall it is to be read, although in the booke of Wisedome it be sayd, that God did foreknow it.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Wisd.</hi> 19.1.</note> It is the saying therefore of <hi>Origen,</hi> That he is very wicked, who beleeveth not of God, <hi>Vt quod nos videmus in praesenti, hoc ille videat in futuro,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Origenes. Augustin.</note> That as we see things present, so he seeth things to come. And S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Austin</hi> also sayth, God is within every thing, because all things are in him, God is without all things, because all things are under him, God is before all things, because all things were made by him, God is after all things, because all things to him are present before that they are. Now as the being of things when they are, and the certaintie of them that they are, while they are, doth not take away their uncertaintie of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they were, nor their mutabilitie either to be or not to be;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:177008:48"/> So neither doth God in his certaine government of the world, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth all things as present to himselfe, either change the mutable nature of things, or take away the uncertaintie of humane events. And as our beholding of things when they are present doth not alter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stabilitie of their condition, nor the contingency of their being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they were; so if there may be any comparison betweene the sight of God and man, the beholding of God, who looketh upon all things as present, doth neither conferre upon him any changeablenesse from the changeablenesse of humane things; nor yet from the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie of Gods beholding, inferre an immutabilitie in the things of mans life. But if in the difficultie of this point, I have not spoken fully enough, if in the darknesse of it I have not spoken cleerely enough; for the first,<note place="margin">Tertull.</note> my hope is, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaketh, <hi>Difficilium facilis erit venia,</hi> that in hard things a pardon will be easie; for the second, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,<note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh, <hi>Sicut multa intelligimus de Deo quae lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui non possumus, ita multa loquimur quae non sumus idonei intelligere,</hi> That as wee understand many things of God which we cannot utter, so we utter many things which wee cannot understand.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 16. The Preacher againe here sayth, <hi>I saw,</hi> as preventing the objection which he saw some ready to make. For having shewed the constant providence of God in ordering and governing the things of the world, he bringeth the objection that is made from the confusion of things in the world. And he giveth an instance in the confusion of judgement and justice: because if God did rule and governe the world, it might seeme that above all things he should not suffer that to be. This is the objection, which to confute <hi>Salvianus</hi> that devout and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Biship of <hi>Marseiles,</hi> hath written eight most excellent bookes: and who in the entrance of his booke, setting downe the objection, sayth,<note place="margin">Salvian. de Guber. Dei. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Incuriosus à quibusdam, &amp; quasi negligens, humanorum actuum, Deus dicitur, utpote nec bonos custodiens, nec coercens malos; quia boni mala omnia patiuntur, mali faciunt,</hi> God is by some sayd to be carelesse and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the affayres of men, as neither preserving the good, nor restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:177008:48"/> the bad: seeing the righteous suffer all evils, the wicked commit them. Thus is the heart of man moved against God, for that, for which he ought to be loved by man, and to be praysed.<note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. in Eccles. Hom. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </note> For as <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> speaketh, <hi>Conqueritur homo, quod malus homo à Deo toleratur, quum manifestum sit quod nullus homo fuisset bonus, si nullus aliquando fuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set toleratus malus,</hi> Man complaineth that evill men are suffered by God, when as it is manifest that no man had been good, if no man that is evill had been sometimes suffered. But to consider the Preachers words. <hi>I saw:</hi> he that had a discerning watchfull eye was able to see it; for commonly such wickednesse is hid, and the place of judgement is made to be a cover for it. <hi>I saw under the Sunne.</hi> The wickednesse that is, is under the Sunne, and as the Preacher sayth, <hi>I saw,</hi> so the Sunne saw it also. It is by the light of the Sunne that sensible things are discerned, and it is by the light of the Sunne of righteousnesse, that wickednesse is discerned. Vnder that Sunne therefore it was also that the Preacher saw it. <hi>I saw under the Sunne the place of Iudgement.</hi> The place of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is that which this world hath: the place where it should be, where it is ordained to be, where it is lookt for, where it is pretended to be, but where it is not. The Preacher saw <hi>that wickednesse was there:</hi> there, where the place of it was never appointed, there, where the place doth no way agree unto it. And therefore the Preacher as not beleeving his eyes, he lookes againe to be sure of it, as being a thing so bad, so strange to be so. But he finds that so it is: and <hi>he saw the place of righteousnesse that iniquitie was there.</hi> The throne which <hi>Solomon</hi> made,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King</hi> 10.18.</note> was overlayd with the best gold, <hi>auro purissimo,</hi> with the most pure gold; and what did this signifie, but the esteeme and price, in which God would have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to be held; as also how pure the judgements should be that from thence are given. But too often, where the seate is gold, he that sits on it is brasse; where the place is the place of judgement and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, wickednesse and iniquitie are found. Or if it shall be thought better to distinguish these two sentences. In the first place, wee may understand the place of them, who are placed in authoritie: in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, wee may understand the place of them, who are placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. For as an ancient Writer speaketh, <hi>Nisi illi per impietatem, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentiam opprimerent, isti per iniquitatem, justitiam non impugnarent. Propterea nam{que} inferiores ad iniquitatem perpetrandam audaces sunt, quia superiores ad tuendam innocentiam non pii sunt,</hi> Vnlesse they by wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse did oppresse innocency, the other by iniquitie would not oppose justice. For therefore are inferiours bold to commit iniquitie, because superiours are not religious in defending of innocency. Or else wee may distinguish the sentences thus: <hi>the place of Iudgement,</hi> wee may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand to be the place of punishing the wicked, but that wickednesse was there. <hi>The place of righteousnesse,</hi> we may understand to be the place of rewarding and cherishing the righteous, but that iniquitie was there, and the righteous were disgraced and afflicted. Or lastly, wee may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and distinguish the sentences thus: <hi>in the place of Iudgement,</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:177008:49"/> wee may apprehend the Iudge as a Iudge, and as giving the judgement of wickednesse, when his place calleth for justice: <hi>in the place of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> wee may understand the Iudge as a man, who in his owne life and conversation, more especially then others, should shew forth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.<note place="margin">Cassiod. var. l. <hi>6.</hi> var. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </note> For as <hi>Cassiodore</hi> speaketh, <hi>Prima aequitas est, in se praesules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choare: ut debeant criminosi metuere, quem non queunt similem reperire. Nullus enim in se culpas timet reus quas habere conspexerit cognitorem,</hi> The first righteousnesse is, that Governours beginne with themselves, that so they who are faultie may feare him, whom they cannot finde like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselves. For a guiltie person never feareth those faults in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which he seeth to be in his Iudge. But where this righteousnesse should be, there is too often iniquitie. And the bad Iudge freeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because he would not condemne himselfe. For as <hi>Cassiodore</hi> also speaketh, <hi>Sicos actus nullus damnat in altero: quia natura est humani animi, ut nitatur potius vindicare, quod se cogno verit admisisse,</hi> No one condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his owne acts in another, because the nature of mans minde is, that it endeavoureth rather to justifie that which himselfe practiseth.</p>

But that <hi>Salvianus</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> may not seeme to oppose one the other: There is a secret judgement, and there is a manifest judgement: by his judgement that is secret, God judgeth every particular in this world, and every singular person when he goes out of the world: by his manifest judgement hee will at last judge all together. <hi>For every purpose and for every worke:</hi> not only the works of men at that time shall be judged, and of which alone man passeth his judgement, but <hi>every purpose</hi> also shall be judged, although it have not proceeded to the working of it. <hi>For every purpose:</hi> the Originall is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which most directly is thus rendred, <hi>Tempus omni voluntati,</hi> A time for every will: a time for Gods will, as well as a time for mans will. And as man now doth whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will, and too often followes the bent of his will, though it cary him to wickednesse; so then God will have his will, then will be the fit time for it.

                     </note> and so I find <hi>Tertullian</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the words. The time of judgement is Gods time, his proper and peculiar time, the fit time for his will to be done upon those who have not done his will: the fit time for his good will to be shewed to those, who have followed his will.

So that these last words may bee referred, either to the time of the judgement, or to God who will be the Iudge. But let not therefore those who are here wronged, be too much afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God shall there doe them right.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 18. The answer of the Preacher having two parts, he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againe his words, <hi>I said in mine heart:</hi> and having answered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, and shewed his just providence, though things may seeme to be neglected by him: here he answereth concerning man to whom the things of this world are so full of disorder and confusion. And because this answer concerneth either the righteous, or the wicked, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it both wayes. First then, the confusion of things in this world in respect of the righteous is, that God might <hi>manifest them,</hi> and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the darknesse of this world they would looke after him. For when God shewed himselfe plainely unto man in his creation, then man departed from God, and turned away from him. God therfore tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:177008:50"/> although he doe not see him. Or else it is <hi>to manifest them</hi> to themselves, that they may see how weake their judgement is, how darke their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, how shallow their insight into the wayes of God, and that they are but <hi>beasts</hi> in respect of God.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 19. If we take this verse as the speech of the righteous, it is their humble confession, and is to be understood of the body only.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:177008:51"/> a third which is covered with the flesh, and dyeth with the flesh. Wherefore although the Spirit in man and beast bee one, in that it is covered in both with flesh; yet it is not one in this, because in the beast the Spirit dyeth, with the flesh, in man it dyeth not. <hi>So that a man hath no praeeminence above a beast:</hi> No, in respect of giving up his breath, hee that hath both the greatest praeeminence among men, hath no praeemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above a beast: but in respect of giving up the Spirit, as the wicked are beneath the very beasts; so the righteous are aequall to the Angels. <hi>For all is vanity:</hi> all is vanity and vanisheth in this mortall life: but after this life, the vanity to the wicked is turned into unsufferable misery; the vanity to the righteous is turned into unexpressable glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 20. <hi>All goe unto one place:</hi> All, for all in this journey are fellow travellers; all both men and beasts. The beast which caryeth man in his journey on the earth, is caryed in an equall condition with man in this journey to the earth. <hi>All goe:</hi> yea, all are alwayes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for there is no journey else, in which there is not some staying, some resting for one occasion or other, but in this journey, there is no time of stay. When once this journey is begun, and begun it is, as soone as life beginneth, there is nothing but a continuall going on. <hi>Alexis</hi> the Poet, being asked what he did, made answer, <hi>Paulatim mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,</hi> I dye by little and little. He was indeed an old man when he spake it, but the youngest may say the same. For as <hi>Seneca</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note>
                     <hi>Paula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim morimur, quia paulatim vita decrescit, hoc autem decrementum, quid aliud est quam mors paulatim procedens?</hi> we dye by little and little, because by little and little our life goeth away, and what else is this going away of life, but a going on by little and little unto death? <hi>All goe unto one place.</hi> It is but one place, there be no upper and lower places in death, but how different soever, the places of men may be while they lived, when they dye, they are all in the same place: yea beasts are in the same place, with the wisest, the richest, the greatest men. They goe to one place, even to the earth. And there indeed is the place, where the beasts doe rest, there is their journeys end. But the righteous and the wicked which hitherto keepe company, there are divided, and take their severall wayes, the one to the place of endlesse comfort, the other to the place of endlesse torment. Wherefore an Ancient Writer saith, <hi>Vna sorte involvuntur justi cum impiis, donec pariter currunt in via, ut quum simul exierint, discernantur, &amp; ordinentur dispariter,</hi> The righteous and the wicked are wrapt up in one condition, while they goe on alike in the way, that when they are gone our together, they may be distinguished, and not alike rewarded. <hi>All are of the dust.</hi> Saint <hi>Basil</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Basilius.</note> that when God made man of the dust of the earth, hee tooke the dust from the fower parts of the earth, that so whither soever men should goe, or wheresoever men might bee, whether East, West, North or South, they might still remember that they were made of that earth:<note place="margin">Chrysolog.

This it is which maketh the earth it selfe at last, to trample upon us all, <hi>when all turne to dust againe.</hi> Now thus God hath appointed it, <hi>Vt per id quo vadit homo, agnoscat unde venerat,</hi> that by the place to which man goeth, he may acknowledge the place from whence he came, as an ancient Writer speaketh: that by the grave wherein his body is laid, he may consider Paradise in which being made hee was set by God; that by the basenesse to which he is brought, hee may consider the glory to which hee was created, and so may seeke carefully to returne thither, before that hee returne to the dust.</p>

                     </note> of the ascending and going upward of the soule: and as for the soules of the wise, <hi>Plato</hi> affirmed them to ascend unto the skie, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> affirmed them to be under the Moone, another affirmed them to ascend only into the ayre. But the Preacher here comparing the spirits of men

And by the manner of the Preachers phrase, I apprehend him to compare the spirit of man unto a purer exhalation, which ascending upward, continueth in the ayre: the spirit of a beast, unto a thicke and blacke vapour, which being dissolved into raine, descendeth and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to the earth.

                     <hi>Qui jumentum hominis comparatione dicatur,</hi> who in comparison of a man may be sayd to be a beast, but yet living more vertuously and godly, doth not goe upward, and to the place of joy.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 22. The Preacher having seene the objections that were made by worldly minds, against the government of the world by Gods divine providence, and having made others to see the truth, by answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them: he resumeth his assertion which he delivered before at the thirteenth verse, and concludeth, Wherefore I see <hi>and perceive that there is nothing better</hi> for man, who cannot see into Gods workes, and the reasons of them, then <hi>that he rejoyce in his owne workes:</hi> there is nothing better for man, who is often forced by the wrongfull doings of others to suffer that wherein he hath no cause of rejoycing, then that he doe therefore rejoyce in those things which he doth himselfe. And seeing that his portion is the same with beasts in that he dyeth, let him take his portion of living comfortably while that he liveth. Seeing he shall not returne when he is gone, let him goe on with cheerefulnesse and contentment while he continueth here. For <hi>that is the portion</hi> which God hath divided to him, that is the talent which God hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him. <hi>His owne works</hi> are they for which he shall answer: and that he may rejoyce in them, let him be carefull that his workes be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and good, for then he may safely rejoyce in them, then he shall be sure to have comfort and joy from them. <hi>Lyra</hi> therefore in this place, expoundeth <hi>his owne works,</hi> to be the works of vertue,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Quae proprie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur humana, alia enim magis dicuntur bestialia,</hi> which properly are sayd to be the works of men, for other works are rather sayd to be the works of beasts. <hi>For who shall bring him to see, what shall be after him?</hi>

And indeed the meaning so is plainly this; There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better then that a man should rejoyce in his owne works, in those which he is able to doe, and which he doth well, and that he should doe them with rejoycing and alacritie: for who shall bring him to see the things that shall be afterwards? How can he know whether he shall be able to doe those things, which now he is able to doe; whether he shall doe those things, which now he doth, whether the things that shall be afterwards will be matter of rejoycing to him or no? But to take the generall reading of the words, <hi>Who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</hi> that is, sayth the French translation, <hi>Qui le remane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra?</hi> Who shall bring him backe when he is gone out of this life, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the things of this life againe? Let him therefore rejoyce in the good use of them, while that he hath them. The Pythagoreans taught a returning of men to this life,<note place="margin">Tertull. de Anima. c. <hi>28</hi>
                     </note> after they were departed. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> tels us, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> to establish this tenet among his Schollers, did hide himselfe in a cave, and to dissemble his feigned death, <hi>Septenni se ille patientia damnabat,</hi> he condemned himselfe to prison there by the space of seven yeares. Now none knew of this but his mother onely, who ministred unto him, and brought him notice still of those who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the meane while, that so by telling of their being dead, as if he had talked with them, he might assure the imagination of his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead. At length appearing againe not unlike one that came out of a Sepulchre, for his cave had changed him, <hi>Ad mortui veteris horrorem,</hi> to the horridnesse of a long dead man; he was received as one that was alive againe. For as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaketh, <hi>Quis non crederet revixisse, qui crediderat obiisse?</hi> Who would not beleeve him to be alive againe, who had beleeved him to be dead? But howsoever, he lyed concerning his owne death, to make his tenet seeme true, that the dead doe live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>Tertullian</hi> well concludeth, <hi>Mortuos quidem ex vivis effici constat, non ideo tamen ex mortuis vivos,</hi> It is most true, that of living men all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dead, but that from the dead, men are made living, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Preacher having wearied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the sad consideration of the miseries and vanities of this world, gave some rest unto his thoughts: but <hi>returning</hi> to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, he passed from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of vaine and temporall things, to the consideration of vaine and sinfull things. And first he beheld <hi>all the oppressions that are done under the Sunne.</hi> Wee reade it <hi>oppressions,</hi> and as I suppose by reason of the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which followes, signifying <hi>fiunt</hi> are done, that agreeing best unto <hi>oppressions.</hi> But the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifieth <hi>Oppressos,</hi> them that are oppressed: and the other Originall word signifieth as well <hi>subiguntur</hi> are brought under, as <hi>fiunt</hi> are done. So that the more direct reading may seeme to be this, that he beheld all the oppressed, which are brought under, under the Sunne. He speakes of <hi>all the oppressed,</hi> as being many. For as one sayth well, <hi>Mundus nescit irasci nisi in innocentes,</hi> the world knoweth not how to be angry but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the innocent. Hence it is, that our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> sayth to his

                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.9.</note> When yee heare of warres and commotions, be not terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: he sayth not, when yee heare of warres and commotions against your selves: supposing that these things must be understood to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the innocent. And therefore the Preacher also here sayth, <hi>And behold the teares of the oppressed,</hi> as if nothing were more common to be seene.<note place="margin">Chrysost. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. de Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom.</note> So that S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> cryeth out, <hi>O Innocentia, quantum apud reos periculi suscipis!</hi> O Innocency, how much dost thou suffer with them that are guiltie! <hi>Vnder the Sunne.</hi> It is the observation of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that God appointed the vehement heate of the Sunne sometimes to scorch the earth,<note place="margin">Theodoret. l. <hi>3.</hi> de Diis &amp; Angelis.</note> and to destroy the fruits of it: <hi>Ne solem vitae causam autorem{que} opinemur,</hi> Least wee should thinke the Sunne to be the cause and authour of life. And I suppose the Preacher shewing the vanities of the world, so often to speake of them as being <hi>under the Sunne,</hi> least any should thinke the Sunne to be the God of the world. Or else wee may conceive him to make mention here of being <hi>under the Sunne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause although the wrongs of the oppressed were most apparent and plaine, yet there was <hi>none to comfort them. And behold the teares:</hi> the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifying <hi>lachrymam, non lachrymas,</hi> a teare (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrew tongue) not teares: as if the oppressed had wept so long for sorrow, or else had wept so much to beg helpe, that they could weepe no longer, could weepe no more, but had <hi>onely a teare</hi> left them, (if I may in this manner borrow an expression of the greatnesse of oppression, which the place intendeth) <hi>And on the side of the oppressours there was power.</hi> The Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> here used, signifieth to oppresse either by fraud or else by violence. Wherefore seeing the oppression is here repeated: in the first place wee may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand oppression by fraud: in this latter place, oppression by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and the rather because it is sayd, <hi>that on the side of the oppressour there was power.</hi> Or else wee may understand it thus, that whereas the oppressed had no comforter to relieve them; the oppressours had friends and great ones to support them. <hi>But they had no comforter:</hi> none on earth, none from heaven, no man was their comforter, neither was God. For he doth reserve comforts for them another where, and here doth sometimes leave them without the comfort of any;<note place="margin">Hugo Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 2. Indeed so many, so great are the miseries of this life, that in comparison of them, even death it selfe is to be preferred before life. For as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Ambros. de fide Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis.</note>
                     <hi>Quid nobis miserius, qui tanquam spoliati &amp; nudi projicimur in hanc vitam, corpore fragili, corde lubrico, imbecillo animo, anxii ad solicitudinem, desidiosi ad labores, proni ad voluptates?</hi> What is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:177008:54"/> more miserable then wee are, who like men naked and spoyled are cast into this life, fraile of body, inconstant of heart, weake of minde, full of cares, sloathfull to labours, prone to pleasures. And therefore one sayth well; <hi>Quomodo potest amari haec vita, tantas habens amaritudines?</hi>

The resolution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is, <hi>Tantis malis haec vita repleta est,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. Serm. <hi>37.</hi> de Sanctis.</note>
                     <hi>ut comparatione ejus mors remedium putetur non poena,</hi> With so great evils is this life stuffed, that in comparison thereof death may be thought a remedy, and not a punishment. For as the same Father elsewhere speaketh,<note place="margin">Ambros. de Bono mortis. c. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Si plena oneris vita, utique finis ejus allevamentum,</hi> If this life be loaded with burdens, then the end of it must needs be an ease. But I understand rather the Preacher in this place to preferre the dead before the living in respect of the evill of sinne. He sayth therefore, <hi>I praysed the dead;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambrosius de fide Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis.</note> he it is <hi>Qui sapientiam poposcit &amp; impetravit,</hi> who asked wisedome and obtained it, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh. <hi>I praised the dead more then the living:</hi> and most justly; for as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh, <hi>Quid est mors nisi sepultura vitiorum?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. de Bono mortis. c. <hi>4.</hi> Luk. <hi>2.29.</hi>
                     </note> What is death but the buriall of vices? And seeing the death of sinne is better then the life of sinne, this must needs make the dead more worthy to be praised than the living. Wherefore doth not old <hi>Simeon</hi> say, Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, <hi>Quasi à vinculis qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busdam ad libertatem festinaret,</hi> as if he hasted from some bonds unto li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie? And indeed they were bonds that did hold him, even bonds that made him captive unto the law of sinne. Doth not <hi>Iacob</hi> say,<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>47.9.</hi> Ambros. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</note> Few and evill have been my dayes? <hi>Mali, non quia dies mali, sed quia nobis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessu dierum incrementa malitiae cumulantur,</hi> Evill, not because the dayes were evill, but because in us the encrease of wickednesse is heaped up by the encrease of dayes.

                     <hi>Nam lucrum est evasisse incrementa peccati,</hi> For it is gaine to have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the gaine and encrease of sinne, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> also speaketh. <hi>The dead which are already dead, more then the living which are yet alive:</hi> that is, sayth <hi>Lyra, Qui sublati sunt ex hac vita,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>antequam experientiam haberent tanti mali,</hi> Who are taken out of this life before they have experience of so great an evill. He that is the Authour of the Commentaries upon the Epistle of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hierome in Epist. ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</note> which are among S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hieromes</hi> workes, reads the words thus, <hi>Laudavi omnes mortuos, qui olim mortui sunt,</hi> I praised all the dead, which are dead long since: as if to be dead any way were better then to be alive: or, as if they who were not onely dead but forgotten, not onely dead but turned into ashes, and their ashes lost, were better then the living. But seeing the Originall word speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of a time past, wee may well understand the Preacher to speake of those who are dead being young, and to preferre them before those who live to elder yeares. For as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Bernard. Meditat. c. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Cur tantopere vitam istam desideramus, in qua quanto amplius vivimus, tanto plus peccamus: quanto est vita longior, tanto culpa numerosior?</hi> Why doe wee so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:177008:55"/> this life, in which by how much the longer wee live, by so much the more wee sinne: by how much our yeares are more, by so much our sinnes are more.<note place="margin">Ambros.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 3. That the Preacher speaketh of the evill of committing of sinne, this confirmeth me, because here he speaketh <hi>of the evill worke, and of the evill that is done. Better is he,</hi> that is not so ill. For we are not so to understand the Preacher, as if he that is not borne, hath any being before he is borne, and that he is the more happy, because he is not yet encumbred with a body, which thing some have imagined: but because it is better, or rather not so ill, at all not to be, then either to be, or else to live unhappily, and wickedly. <hi>Better is he then both they,</hi> that is, sayth <hi>Lyra</hi> well,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Malo homine mortuo, &amp; malo homine vivente,</hi> An evill man dead, and an evill man living. <hi>Better is he then both they, who hath not yet been:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. Serm. <hi>18.</hi> in Psal. <hi>118.</hi>
                     </note> Wherefore S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth, <hi>Mortuus praefertur viventi, quia peccare desinit: mortuo praefertur qui nondum natus est, quia peccare nescivit;</hi> He that is dead is preferred before the living, because he ceaseth to sinne; and he that is not borne is preferred before the dead, because he hath not knowne how to sinne. <hi>Who hath not seene the evill worke that is done under the Sunne:</hi> if wee understand the words of the evill of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it may serve to expresse the greatnesse of humane misery, though in it selfe it be not so to be taken; and better is he that is not yet borne, then both they, either he that is already dead, or he that is yet living. For as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers. Cicero in Tuscul. <hi>1<seg rend="sup">a</seg>.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Alius mala adhuc patitur, alius quaesi nudus de naufragio evasit,</hi> The one doth yet suffer evils still, the other is but esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as one naked from shipwracke. And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> could say, <hi>Non nasci longe optimum,</hi> not to be borne is the best of all. And howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, <hi>Solomon</hi> alone hath expresly delivered this sentence, it is not the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Solomon</hi> alone.<note place="margin">Iob <hi>3.3.</hi> Ambros. de fide Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</note> For <hi>Iob</hi> sayth, <hi>Let the day perish wherein I was borne,</hi> and that he sayth as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> expoundeth him, <hi>Quia cognoverat nasci malorum omnium principium esse, &amp; ideo diem quo natus est perire opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, ut tolleretur origo incommodorum,</hi> Because he knew, that to be borne was the beginning of all evils; and therefore he wished that the day of his birth might perish, that so the beginning of evils and troubles might be taken away. But as I have sayd, I understand the Preacher here ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to speake of the evill of sinne:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.24.</note> and in that respect it is that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Christ</hi> speaking of <hi>Iudas,</hi> sayth, <hi>It had been good for that man if he had not been borne.</hi>

                     </note> For as one sayth very well, <hi>Majus malum peccatum est, quam non esse, &amp; melius esset non esse quam peccasse,</hi> To sinne is a greater evill then not to be, and it is better not to be then to sinne. In generall, the reason is given by <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> thus, <hi>Quod longius à malo est in bono, ipsum majus est bonum. Si ergo malum est esse, bonum utique est non
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177008:55"/> esse, &amp; multo melius utro{que} non fuisse;</hi> That which in good things is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest from evill, is the greater good. And therefore if it bee evill to bee, it is good not to be, and much better then both, not to have beene at all.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 4. The Preacher having considered the sinfull vanity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice which oppresseth right, hee considereth next the sinfull vanity of envy, which opposeth right doing, saying, <hi>I considered all travaile and every right worke: Olympiodorus</hi> reads it,<note place="margin">Olympiad.</note>
                     <hi>Omnem laborem &amp; omnem for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem operis,</hi> all labour and all strength of worke; as if the Preacher intended only the paines of labour, and a patient courage in the enduring of it. But the Originall is more large, and speaketh of the generall rightnesse of worke. And this rightnesse may be taken either for the hansome rightnesse of a worke, as it is a worke, and so the Vulgar Latin according to the Septuagint doe take it, rendring it <hi>Industrias,</hi> that is an aptnesse in the doing of things: or else the rightnesse may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more largely, either for the rightnesse of a worke as it is a worke, or else for the rightnesse of a worke according to the rules of vertue, and so Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> may seeme to take it,<note place="margin">Hieronym.</note> who renders it <hi>omnem vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem operis,</hi> all vertue of worke. <hi>That for this a man is envied:</hi> When <hi>Abraham</hi> had rescued <hi>Lot,</hi> and conquered those Kings by whom he was taken prisoner, afterwards the word of the Lord came unto him say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Feare not Abraham, I am thy shield.</hi>

                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1.</note> If this had beene spoken to him before the battle, it might have beene done to encourage him: but being spoken to him after the battle and victory, they seeme to arme him against a new combat of envy which his valiant and well doing was ready to bring upon him. For this is the difference betweene envy and other vices: that they are cured by the good examples of others, but the goodnes of others is that from which this sin ariseth. Old <hi>Iacob</hi> speaking of his sonne <hi>Ioseph</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.23.</note> that the Archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> expounding

                     <hi>Hic invidiam cum arcu &amp; sagittis introduci ad sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum quod immaculatum est,</hi> That here envy is brought in with bow and arrowes shooting at that which is immaculate, and where there is no spot to bee a marke for it. Or else, as an Archer doth set up some white thing to be the marke at which he shoots, so it is the whitenesse of some good thing, against which the height of envy is caryed. And therefore,<note place="margin">

The Preacher here speaketh <hi>of all labour, and of every right worke:</hi> for if it be right, whatsoever it be, though never so small, it is by envy opposed; that will seeke to hinder the labour in the doing of it, that will seeke to overthrow the rightnesse of it when it is done. Yea it is the nature of envy to make little things appeare to be great. Wherefore it is reported by <hi>Panormitanus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Panormit.</note> that a question being moved before <hi>Fredericke</hi> the King, what was good for the eye sight, and the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians answering some one thing, some another; <hi>Sannizarius</hi> answered that envy was very good: at which there being a smiling, he gave his reason for it; because that doth make all things appeare bigger then they are. <hi>For this a man is envyed of his neighbour:</hi> nay of his Father in Law. For did not this make <hi>Saul</hi> to envy <hi>David,</hi> so that <hi>David</hi> flying to <hi>Achish, Maluit hosti quam invidiae subjacere,</hi> he had rather be under an enemy,<note place="margin">Hieronym. Epist. ad Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stochium.</note> then under envy, as St. <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh: Nay, of his brother, when there was but one brother in the world. For did not this make <hi>Cain</hi> to envy <hi>Abel, Vt esse solum zeli livor faceret, quem primum fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat lex naturae,</hi> So that the rage of envy made him to be alone, whom the law of nature had made to bee the first:<note place="margin">Chrysolog. Serm. <hi>4.</hi> de duóbus filiis.</note> as <hi>Chrysologus</hi> speaketh. For indeed there is nothing so contrary to charity and affection, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of nature or grace, or the neighborhood of place as envy is. <hi>This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</hi> First vanity, for what is more vaine, then that as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh, <hi>Aliena gloria plus offendant quam proprium damnum,</hi> Anothers honour should more offend a man, than his owne hurt? And yet was it not so with envious <hi>Saul,</hi> who when <hi>David</hi> played on his harp to cure him of the evill spirit, did throw his Speare at him, <hi>Malens a malo spiritu torqueri, quam Davidem vivere,</hi> choosing rather to bee tormented by an evill spirit, then that <hi>David</hi> should live,<note place="margin">Bern. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. domo. c. <hi>2.</hi> Cypr. de zelo &amp; livore.</note> as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh. For what is more vaine, then as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> speaketh, <hi>In malum proprium convertere bona aliena, aliorum gloriam facere poenam suam, &amp; nullius magìs quam suae salutis hostem esse,</hi> To turne the good things of another to bee evill to himselfe, to make the glory of another to be his punishment, and to bee an enemy to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much, as to his owne welfare? Secondly, <hi>vexation of spirit:</hi> in which respect Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Chrys. in <hi>2.</hi> ad Corinth. Homil. <hi>19.</hi>

                     <hi>Praestat serpentem provolutum in visceribus habere quam invidiam,</hi> A man were better have a Serpent tumbling in his bowels then envy. For if a Serpent have food given it, it will not feed upon a man; but the more food is given to envy, the

                     </note>
                     <hi>Chrysologus</hi> therefore speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of envy saith, that being <hi>Suorum carnifex, torquet animos, discruciat mentes, corrumpit corda, &amp; quid plura? hanc qui suscipit, sua sustinet sine fine supplicia; nam quot sunt prosperitates hominum, tot sunt tormenta in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidorum,</hi> the executioner of them that entertaine it: it tortureth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, it vexeth the minde, it corrupteth the heart, and what need of more? whosoever receiveth it, endureth without end his owne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for as many as are the prosperities of men, so many are the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the envious. Such is the vexation of spirit which envie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that it is one of the torments of hell. For our Saviour Christ speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them saith, There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, <hi>when yee shall see Abraham and Isaac and Iacob and all the Prophets in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> For as <hi>Cajetan</hi> upon the words addeth,<note place="margin">Luk. <hi>13.28.</hi> Cajet.

                     <hi>Nimis invidum torquet foelicitas aliorum,</hi> The happinesse of others, doth extreamely torment the envious.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 5. This verse may be either referred to the verse before, or else considered as speaking of another sinfull vanity to which the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher passeth. If it be referred to the former verse, then <hi>the foole</hi> here is the envious man; for what greater foole then he, who not looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne evills to bee grieved for them, is vexed with the good of another. He it is <hi>who foldeth his hands together,</hi> as a man discontented and heavy for the contentment which another hath and enjoyeth, and as studying and plotting with himselfe how he may bereave him of it; and as desiring to enwrap him within the traps of his envie as he enwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his owne hands. He it is that <hi>eateth his owne flesh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Greg. Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anz. in Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione de Seip.</note> For as <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> speaketh, <hi>Invidia tabes est possessoris, virus &amp; rubigo eorum qui ea exagitantur,</hi> Envie is the consumption of the possessour of it, the poyson and rust of them that are troubled with it. <hi>He eateth his own flesh,</hi> not sparing to hurt himselfe, that he may hurt him whom he envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. To which purpose <hi>Lyra</hi> tels us a story, which is taken out of Aesop, That in a certaine City there were two men, the one very covetous, the other, very envious: the Ruler therefore of the City sent for them both, wishing them to desire what they would, and it should be granted them: adding withall, that he who did aske first, should have his asking gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the other should have the same doubled. Now hereupon the covetous man would not aske first, because he would have the request doubled: the envious man would not aske first, that his companion might not have more than himselfe. But the Ruler pressing them to aske,<note place="margin">Lyra in c. <hi>3.</hi> Geneseos.</note> the envious man asked that one of his owne eyes might be pulled out, that so his companion might loose both of his eyes. But if this verse be considered as containing another sinfull vanity, to which the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher passeth, then <hi>the foole</hi> is the sloathfull person, the contrary to the laborious man of whom the former verse speaketh,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. in Ecclesiast. Homil. <hi>19.</hi>
                     </note> and who <hi>Reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit operantem, &amp; quasi solicitum arguit, ut ipse sit dissolutus,</hi> Blameth the painefull man, and reproveth him as too carefull, that himselfe may be carelesse, as <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> speaketh. Now hee is called a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:177008:57"/> foole, because there is nothing that doth more dull and besot the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing then idle and sluggish lazinesse. And indeed what a foole is he, who thinketh not of providing for the time to come, who hopeth to fill his hands with things needfull when they are folded together. <hi>He foldeth his hands,</hi> that they may not be reached out to worke, and as it were making a covenant with idlenesse and sloath. <hi>Hee eateth his owne flesh:</hi> for having made himselfe fat by ease, he consumeth himselfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by want and misery. <hi>He eateth his owne flesh,</hi> that is, he wasteth his estate to nothing, and brings himselfe to wofull distresse. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when <hi>Ioseph</hi> having bought the land of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> gave it unto them againe to dresse it, and to till it, paying unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> a great tribute out of it:<note place="margin">Ambros. de Offic. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> conceiveth, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> did it in compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: because the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> being of it selfe very fruitfull, that made them to be idle, the cause of much misery: whereas the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but which they payd unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> made them to be industrious, which kept them the freer from distresse.<note place="margin">Ambrosi. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistolarum. l. <hi>4.</hi> Epist. <hi>30.</hi>
                     </note> But Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> giveth of this place another exposition, he saith, <hi>Stultus complexus est manus suas, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voravit viscera sua, id est, corporalibus se implicavit negotiis, ut non invenerit vitam aeternam.</hi> The foole hath folded his hands, and devoured his own bowels, that is, he hath entangled himselfe in bodily affaires, so that he shall not find eternall life.<note place="margin">Ambros. in Psal. <hi>104.</hi>
                     </note> So in another place he saith, He hath embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his hands, and devoured his owne bowels, <hi>Carnalia magis cogitans, quam spiritualia,</hi> thinking more of carnall things then of spirituall. To the same purpose another Ancient Writer expounding these words saith,<note place="margin">Graecus in Catena Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Glossa Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar.</note>
                     <hi>Otiosus actiones suas infames amplexatur &amp; deglutit,</hi> The idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son embraceth his own infamous actions and swalloweth them downe. And so the ordinary Glosse expounding also this verse saith, <hi>He eateth his owne flesh, Carnalibus scilicet desideriis tabescens donec consumatur,</hi> namely, wasting away in carnall delights and lusts, untill hee bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 6. If we understand the former verse, as speaking of the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person, this verse giveth me occasion to apprehend another sense in it. And <hi>by the folding of his hands together,</hi> we may understand, his scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping after worldly things, and his greedy clasping of them; <hi>by the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his owne flesh,</hi> we may understand his wasting of himselfe with care and vexation in the seeking and getting of them. For that is the nature of envie, it maketh men greedy after those things which they envie at in another, and giveth them no quietnesse by striving to exceed another in them. But the Preacher framing his owne conclusion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this whereof he had last spoken, saith, that <hi>better is a handfull with quietnesse,</hi> &amp;c. Where the comparison is not only in respect of one handfull and two, as shewing that one with quietnesse is better than two with trouble. But in the first place the Originall word signifieth the palme of the hand; in the second place it signifieth the whole hand clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed together to hold any thing. So that the meaning also is, that a little, even no more than a man can hold in the hollow of his hand being
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:177008:57"/> spread abroad, is better than much which a man holdeth in both his hands, bended and folded to hold as much as they can: if the little be with quietnesse, the much with trouble and vexation of spirit. But then the little must be a fulnesse also, it must bee a handfull, it must be <hi>pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo volae,</hi> a fulnesse of the hollow of the hand, as the Hebrew is, it must be fully so much as shall be sufficient for his needefull and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent occasions that want and distresse do not disquiet a man. For it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency with quietnesse that is better then abundance with trouble. One hand serves to feed a man and it doth it better to his health, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on wholesome meate, then two hands glutting him with super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous dainties, and breeding diseases in him. In <hi>Cassian</hi> it is set downe to be the tale of <hi>Abbot Macarius.</hi> That in a certaine City there was a Barber, who trimming men for 3. pence a peece had many customers, and found his estate to encrease well by it: but hearing that in a City a farre off, there was twelve pence given for trimming a man, he would needs goe thither: but when hee came and found it to bee so, going to buy provision of food, he found that to bee so deare, that his great hire for trimming was all spent in that, so that he had nothing to lay up for his old age, which made him to thinke himselfe better in the former City, though his hire was lesse.<note place="margin">Cassian. Col. <hi>24.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Cassian</hi> applyeth it to quietnesse and trouble, though in another manner, then I have here occasion. But surely a little gotten and possessed where quietnesse layeth up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it, is better than much, <hi>Quod curae arrodunt, solicitudines immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuunt;</hi> the comfort whereof cares gnaw away, and troubles diminish. When God had made man, wee read that the next day he rested, and why is this set downe saith <hi>Anselme, Nisi per hoc vellet innuere,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Anselm. in c. <hi>4.</hi> Epist. ad Roman.</note>
                     <hi>quod il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum post cujus orationem requievit, adrequiem fecit?</hi> But that the Spirit of God would shew unto us, that God made him for rest, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of whom God is said to have rested. It is rest and quietnesse, that is the proper gift of man by God bestowed upon him, and this it is which is the good of man. When <hi>Martha</hi> was busied to entertaine our Saviour, he blamed her for it: but as <hi>Theophylact</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theophylact.</note> noteth, <hi>Non hospitalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Dominus prohibet, sed turbationem &amp; tumultum,</hi> It was not her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality that our Saviour disliked, but the trouble and tumult of her mind. This taketh away the comfort, the good of what any one hath, though there be much that might afford it. The Originall here is, <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo volae quietis,</hi> The fulnesse of the hand of quietnesse: and let it be the hand of quietnesse that doth reach it unto us, though it be but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that will make it to be a fulnesse, and that little fulnesse it will make to be better then much fulnesse of the hands of trouble and vexation of spirit, (for so also the Originall is) that is, then much fulnesse which travell reacheth with one hand, and vexation of spirit with another hand. But the Septuagint doe adde unto the end of the former verse, <hi>Dicens,</hi> saying: and <hi>Tremellius</hi> puts into this verse, <hi>Inquit,</hi> saith he, as if these were the words of the foole in the former verse. And if wee take the foole to bee the sluggard, hee may be conceited to say so, as applauding
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:177008:58"/> himselfe in his owne lazinesse, wherein he is at quiet, though he have but little, and therefore preferring himselfe before those, who though they get more, yet it is with more travell and vexation of spirit. Wherein wee may note how idlenesse would cloake it selfe with the commendation of quietnesse, and the idle person please himselfe with the comfort of wanting trouble, the like being the manner of other sinnes also,<note place="margin">Hugo de Sanct. Vict. in Ecclesiast. Homil. <hi>19,</hi>
                     </note> and of other sinners. But as <hi>Hugo de Sancto Victore</hi> noteth, the foole considereth himselfe, <hi>Quando pugillum habet &amp; requiem habet,</hi> when he hath his handfull and hath rest also, hee considereth not that when his handfull is emptyed, his rest will be gone likewise. He now eateth of his handfull in quietnesse, and commendeth his lazinesse, not caring to fill his other hand by labour, that thereon he may feed, when the other is spent. Wherefore when his handfull is consumed, then he eateth his owne flesh, and with hunger is whipt for his lazinesse, the rest whereof hee preferred before dew carefulnesse. But I would not have so worthy a sentence to bee lost in the mouth of a foole; for surely better is a handfull, where quietnesse filleth the heart, then both the hands full, where travell and vexation overwhelme the spirit. And therefore to take it as the speech of <hi>Solomon</hi> himselfe, and yet to apply it unto the slothfull foole, we may conceive that as in the verse before, he sheweth his misery in his wasted estate; so here he sheweth his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a plentifull estate. For as much as then also idlenesse maketh his life to be tedious and irksome unto him. So that he who laboureth and getteth but a little, yet by labour hath a quiet mind free from a burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some tediousnesse is to be preferred before him.</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:177008:58"/> forth of vanitie: then wee may imagine the Preachers thoughts to have been so fast in the depth of those vanities, as one amazed with the folly of them, that he was faine to recall himselfe, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himselfe as it were, that he might passe unto another matter. <hi>And I saw vanitie:</hi> it is from vanitie that wee fall into iniquitie, and as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh; <hi>Dum per quaedam transitoria ducimur,</hi>

The Preacher therefore in his method, having considered first the transitory vanitie of worldly things, from thence he passeth in this Chapter, to the iniquitie of the world, which is a vanitie also, for so he calleth it. And indeed this vanitie it was which made <hi>Belshazzar</hi> to weigh so light in the ballance:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.27.</note> it was his iniquitie which made him to be found wanting, wanting of any true worth, so that his kingdome and his life vanished so quickly from him.

This is the good whereof a covetous wretch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaveth his soule. And plainely, were it not the minde of such a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous wretch to desire no children, no brethren, no kinsfolke, he might finde enough. For as <hi>Olympiodorus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Olympiodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note> speaketh, <hi>Qui desiderio illorum tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quamvis naturâ nullos affines &amp; consanguineos habeat, charitatem tamen habens, omnes homines quamvis externos, esse sibi filiorum loco putat &amp; fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,</hi> He that hath a desire of them, although by nature he hath no kinsfolke, no kindred, yet having charitie he accompteth all men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though strangers, to be in the place of children and brethren unto him. Wherefore the <hi>Catena Graeca</hi> sayth, <hi>Si quis fratrem non habet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Catena Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</note>
                     <hi>ille procul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubio spiritum adoptionis filiorum non accepit: et si quis pater non est, is porro improbus est,</hi> If there be any one who hath not a brother, no doubt he hath not received the Spirit of adoption of the Sonnes of God: and if any one be not a Father, what is he but a wicked man? <hi>This is also va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, yea it is a sore travaile:</hi> for he that laboureth and enjoyeth his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, receiveth some fruit from it; and he that laboureth but doth not use those things, which by his labour he hath gotten, yet if he leave them to those whom he loveth, <hi>Aliquod emolumentum capit laboris sui, desiderium et votum dilectionis suae,</hi> He reapeth some profit of his labour, in the desire and contentment of his love, as one sayth. But to labour, and thereby neither to enjoy comfort to a mans selfe, nor to expresse love to others, what can be more vaine? What more sore travaile can there be? The ancient Fathers tooke such joy in meditating upon <hi>Christ,</hi> that wheresoever they could finde any occasion, their learned skill made the words of Scripture to sound this musick. This verse therefore S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, that some did apply to <hi>Christ.</hi> For he is <hi>one, and there is not a second,</hi> because he came to save the world without any company: and though there be many <hi>Sonnes</hi> of God, many who by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption are called his <hi>brethren,</hi> yet there was none worthy in this worke to be joyned with him. Of his <hi>labour</hi> in bearing our sinnes and in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for us, there is <hi>no end,</hi> mans understanding cannot reach to the end of the greatnesse of them. <hi>His eye is not satisfied</hi> with riches,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> alwayes desiring and seeking our salvation: neither doth he say, <hi>for whom doe I labour?</hi> for though we despise his love, refuse his mercies, yet doth he still labour to bring us to repentance, to winne us to himselfe.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 9. From the wretchednesse of a covetous solitarinesse, the Preacher passeth to the commendation of a friendly societie. Now <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> tels us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aquin.</hi> 2.2<seg rend="sup">ae</seg>. <hi>Q.</hi> 188. <hi>Ar.</hi> 8.</note>
                     <hi>Id quod est solitarium debet esse sibi per se sufficiens,</hi> That which is solitary must be in it selfe sufficient for it selfe. But what is so? When man was created in his perfection, then it was not good for man to be alone, much lesse now, when his miseries are so great, his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities so many, in regard whereof he hath need of societie, that his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series may be succoured, his infirmities supported. There is none suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in himselfe but God alone, and he is one and alone in his nature and essence, though in his subsistence there be a Trinitie of persons, that from himselfe he might commend a societie to us. The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher therefore sayth,<note place="margin">Aristoteles Politico. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Ille qui non communicat aliis est bestia, aut Deus,</hi> He that doth not communicate with others, is either a beast in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage wildnesse of his minde, or else a God in the transcendency of his nature. But to consider the Preachers words: <hi>two,</hi> sayth he, <hi>are better then one,</hi> but then, though two, they must be one likewise. So it was when God made first two, he made them so two, as that he made them one, and it is still the being one of two, that maketh two to be better then one. One they must be in peace, one in affection, one in a mutuall correspondency of the offices of societie, or else much better one by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:177008:60"/> himselfe alone, then multiplyed into quarrels and discontentments by another joyned with him. But in peace better are two then one eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way. Better in Religion, for where two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there is God, and what is better then to have God with us? Better in the study of knowledge, and therefore S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> writing to <hi>Rasticus</hi> sayth, <hi>Mihi placet, ut habeas Sanctorum contubernium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. ad Rust. Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum.</note>
                     <hi>nec ipse te doceas,</hi> I like rather that thou shouldest use the familiaritie of religious men, and not teach thy selfe. Better in the affayres of the world, for what is better then to take the advise of others, in that which a man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about, so that as <hi>Synesius</hi> speaketh, <hi>Et omnium oculis videat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Synesius. l. de regno.</note>
                     <hi>et om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium auribus audiat, omniumque animis in unum consentientibus consilium capiat,</hi> He may see with the eyes of all, he may heare with the eares of all, and with the minds of all agreeing in one, he may resolve what to doe. Which yet is not so generally true, but that it is better some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be alone: alone in the fervency of devotion, alone in the height of contemplation. But that wee may be alone for the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of these, wee must be alone not onely from the company of men, but also from the company of distracting thoughts, of worldly considerations. Otherwise as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Gregor. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. c. <hi>30.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Quid prodest solitudo corporis, si non sit solitudo cordis?</hi> What availeth the solitarinesse of the body, if there be not a solitarinesse of the minde? But for the most part two are better then one, <hi>because they have a good reward for their labour.</hi> One would thinke the Preacher should have sayd, because they have a good reward for or in their societie. And indeed so doe the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint reade it, <hi>Habent enim emolumentum societatis suae,</hi> for they have the benefit of their societie. The very societie it selfe being a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto them. And therefore S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Austin</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Augustin. l. de Amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</note>
                     <hi>Quid sit vera ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citia nondum novit, qui vult aliam esse mercedem quam ipsam,</hi> What true friendship is he doth not as yet know, who desireth any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then it selfe. But the originall word here used is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifying trouble or labour: and therefore the Preacher seemeth to me here to shew, that in the getting and keeping of good societie, there is no little trouble and labour. For there is company enough to be had, but to get good company, good in it selfe, good for our occasions and dispositions is no easie matter. And when such company is gotten, he that will not endure trouble and labour through many occurrences that may and will fall out, shall soone loose it againe. But let this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and trouble be endured, because it hath a good reward which from societie ariseth. And it may farther be noted, that it is sayd, <hi>Their labour,</hi> because both must labour for the establishing and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of a good societie, or else it will not be. Or else the meaning of the words may be, they have a good reward for their labour, that is, in societie they have a benefit, whereby to ease themselves in their labour. Or else thus, that by societie they have the benefit of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more sweetly and comfortably those things which they have gotten by their labour. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> goeth on in applying these words
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:177008:61"/> also unto <hi>Christ:</hi> Two sayth he, are better then one, <hi>Melius est enim ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitantem in se habere Christum, quam solum patere insidiis adversantis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> For it is better to have <hi>Christ</hi> dwelling in us, then alone to lye open to the snares of the enemy. And no doubt, there is a reward in the labour of <hi>Christ</hi> and his servants. But as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth, <hi>Christus ergo laborat?</hi> Doth <hi>Christ</hi> therefore labour?<note place="margin">Ambros. in haec verba, Cohortatione ad Cleric.</note> Yes, sayth he, <hi>Laborat, sed in nobis,</hi> He laboureth, but in us. He laboureth by making us to labour, by suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us in our labour: and he that laboureth in us, giveth a reward of our labour to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 10. The Septuagint, S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome, Pagnine, Arias Montanus,</hi> doe all reade it, <hi>Si ceciderit unus,</hi> If the one fall, as not suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that both should fall together. But though if the one stand, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall, he that standeth will the better be able to helpe up him that is fallen; yet if they both fall, they may also helpe one the other in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and therein also the mutuall helpe of societie is the better set forth. Now the Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Si ceciderint,</hi> If they fall, the one will lift up his fellow. It is not sayd he may doe it, but he will doe it: neither is it sayd the one will lift up the other, but the one will lift up his fellow. For if there be a fellowship of love, and true societie betweene them, he will doe what he can, he will not let his fellow lye being downe, but he will lift him up, and he will helpe up his fellow as well as himselfe, if they be both downe. And it is for this reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Preacher,<note place="margin">Hieronym. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. <hi>12.</hi> ad Abigaum.</note> that S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> speaking of himselfe sayth, <hi>Vltra soleo bonorum appetere necessitudinem, &amp; me eorum ingerere charitati,</hi> I use to seeke of my selfe the friendship of those that are good, and even to thrust my selfe into their affection. <hi>But woe to him that is alone when he falleth:</hi> woe because he falleth, but a double woe, because he falleth when he is alone. Perhaps he may not be alone, in respect of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that thrusteth him downe, and that may be some ease unto his woe, in regard that not falling of himselfe, he may be able to helpe himselfe up againe. But howsoever, another joyned with him, would helpe him up much better, and therefore woe unto him because he hath not the helpe of such a one. The Originall is, woe unto him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>secundum,</hi> a second to helpe him up: and indeed this is the right use of a second. Not as the bloudy fashion of the world is, who seeking to kill their enemy, desire to kill their friend also. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> marking the woe here set downe, thereupon fayth,<note place="margin">Augustin. de Amicit.</note>
                     <hi>At quae foelicitas, quae securitas, quae jucunditas est habere cum quo aeque audeas loqui ac tibi, cui confiteri non timeas, si quid deliqueris?</hi> But what happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, what securitie, what sweetnesse is it to have one with whom thou mayest talke as to thy selfe, to whom if thou hast offended thou mayest be bold to confesse thy fault? And as it is a great happinesse to have such a one to whom it may be done, so it is often a great neglect of happinesse not to doe it. For many times when the devill tempteth some one to wickednesse, the very discovering of it to another, is a present remedy for the preventing of it: So that, as Abbot <hi>Moyses</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:177008:61"/> in <hi>Cassian, Teterrimus serpens,</hi>

                     <hi>velut à tenebroso ac subterraneo specu vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute confessionis fubte actus in lucem, &amp; traductus quodammodo &amp; dehonesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus abscedit,</hi> The most fowle serpent, as it were drawne out into the light by the vertue of confession from his darke and subterranean hole, layd open as it were and shamed, departeth away. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> still applyeth this unto our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> saying, <hi>Si unus ceciderit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Christus eriget participem suum: sed vae ei qui quum ruerit Christum non habet erigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> If one fall, <hi>Christ</hi> doth raise him up that is partaker of him; but woe to him, who when he falleth hath not <hi>Christ</hi> in him to raise him up againe. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> also applying this to <hi>Christ;</hi> first, he tels us that <hi>Christ, projecit se, non cecidit,</hi> Did not fall, but did cast himselfe downe;<note place="margin">Ambros. in Cohortati. ad Clericos.</note> he humbled himselfe, that he might make us to be his fellowes. And then he noteth that he is sayd to raise us up, not to be raised up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when he was downe, he raised up himselfe. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> more generally applying these words unto God, sayth, <hi>Solus est,</hi>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 11. <hi>If two lye together</hi> in the cold night of sorrow and sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they have the <hi>heate</hi> of comfort, which mutually they yeeld one to the other, even by striking together the hard flints of their misery, by easing their hearts, while their tongues talke of their distresse, by supporting each other under their burdens, who cannot beare his owne, by doubling the light of counsell which may the better shew them the way of getting out. <hi>If two lye together</hi> in the prison of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, societie gives <hi>heate</hi> unto their cold irons, softens the hardnesse of them, and though it cannot breake them off, yet makes them to be borne with the more contentment. Not because it is an ease to mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to see another in misery, which is the miserable comfort of bad mindes; but because in each, the feeling of his owne misery makes them the more ready to afford comfort one to the other. It is not sayd, if two sleepe together, although the Septuagint, S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> doe reade it so, and although naturally sleeping together, as well as lying together bringeth heate: but it is sayd, <hi>If two lye together,</hi> and in a morall sense, which is here intended by the Preacher, it must be so taken: because if two lying together in misery, sleepe carelesly in it, the heate will be little, the comfort small which one shall have from the other. And farther, this <hi>lying together,</hi> must be also under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, in the bed of good will and affection, otherwise though lying together they may be farre enough from the heate of mutuall comfort. Wherefore <hi>Lyra</hi> tels us,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Per hoc intelligitur quietatio plurium in una di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectione,</hi> By this is understood the resting of many in one affection,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:177008:62"/> and love of charity. Now if two lye together in this bed of love, they will lye together in the same misery, although but one be in it, by a fellow feeling of it, and by his care to give the heate of comfort unto him that suffereth it. And thus to lye with another by a loving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion in his misery and by a readinesse to afford the heate of comfort unto him,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</note> who should not be forward?

                     <hi>Non dicit, quis infirmatur, &amp; ego non compatior, sed ego non infirmor, hoc est, tanquam ipsamet infirmitate circundatus ita excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cior &amp; angor?</hi> He saith not who is weake, and I have not compassion on him, but who is weake, and I am not weake, that is, as if I were encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with the same infirmity, so am I pained, so troubled: And <hi>Anselme</hi> expounding the latter words,<note place="margin">Ansel.

Here was heate indeed, ever burning heate which came from that lying together where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Preacher speaks. But where is another such to be found? The Preacher speaks but of two lying together, and they are very few, who do thus lye together in the bed of charity. <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eusebius.</note> tels us that a Poppy is the embleme of a City. Now a Poppy is like unto a Pompegranate having many graines within it: but the difference is, that in a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate the graines are fastned together, whereas in the Poppy they are loose the one from the other. This therefore it is which maketh a Poppy to bee the embleme of a City, because the affections of men are severed and divided, and they lye not together to cause a heate of consolation the one to the other. But not to understand the Preacher of misery only, it is true of prosperity likewise, and a lying together in love doth make the heate of joy therein to bee the greater. It is true also of the heate of devotion, and the society of others doth make that heate to burne by much the stronger.<note place="margin">Seneca in Epist. <hi>96.</hi>

                     <hi>Seneca</hi> speaking of the conversation of good men saith, <hi>Frequenter audiri &amp; aspici frequenter, imo occursus ipse bonorum juvat, &amp; est aliquid quod ex magno viro vel ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente proficias.</hi> Often to bee heard, and often to be seene, yea the very meeting with good men furthereth, and there is some profit to be gotten from a worthy man even holding his peace. Wherefore if they <hi>lye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> if they continue much together, how great a heate of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse will be stirred up in them?

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 12. There are three things which concerne the life of man in this world, a weakenesse in falling, a misery in lying, a strength in standing, and in all these the Preacher sheweth the benefit of society. Wherefore having already shewed it in the two former here he shewes it in the last. And here he shewes two things, first how by society an enemy is withstood and resisted, secondly how by society he is vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and lead captive as bound with a threefold cord. First, then hee saith, <hi>And if one prevaile against him;</hi> that is, if one prevaile against one as being too strong for him, <hi>two shall withstand him.</hi> For as the Proverb is, <hi>Ne Hercules contra duos,</hi> The strength of <hi>Hercules</hi> is not able to prevaile against two united in their strength. When the Red Sea was divided, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> as not fearing either part by it selfe, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed after the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as insulting over the weakenesse of the waters; but when the two sides meeting in society joyned their strength, how soone were the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> destroyed?<note place="margin">Tertull. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. l. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> So that as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaketh <hi>Egyptium exercitum concordia undarum obruit,</hi> the concord of the waters overwhelmed the Egyptian army. And surely though the weakenesse of one may bee as water in resisting another, yet another though feeble as water also being joyned to him, they may bee able to withstand a great might. And because there is one common enemy of all, that is the devill, who seeketh especially to fight in diuels, and by single com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat against us, as knowing our weakenesse, and his owne advantage therein, let it be the care of every one by the society of counsell, and of prayer to withstand him. Two doe often resist him, when one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, <hi>and a threefold cord is not easily broken.</hi> Much may be noted from the sacred Scriptures of the mystery of three. And upon these words Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Vt cognoscas secundum mysterium dictum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambr. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horta. ad Clericos.</note>
                     <hi>non se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum numerum, Optimi duo super unum, subjecit mysticum, &amp; spartum triplex non facile rumpitur,</hi> That thou mayest know that it is spoken in a mystery, not for the number, Two are better than one, hee addeth a a mysticall thing, A threefold cord is not soone broken, <hi>Tria enim non composita non rumpuntur,</hi> for three which are not compounded, are not broken, and the Trinity which is of an uncompounded nature, cannot
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:177008:63"/> be divided, because God who is one and simple is whatsoever is. But not to dive beyond the bottome of the words, if in the number three wee will note a mystery, the strength of it, is that, to which the words point,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17.</note> and wee may remember the three children united in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to have beene so strong, that they withstood the force of the fiery furnace though made exceeding hot.<note place="margin">Zeno.

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed such is the force of many, that it is able to withstand the power of Gods provoked wrath. Wherefore when God saith, should not I spare <hi>Niniveh</hi> that great City, wherein are more than sixescore thousand persons?<note place="margin">Chrys. Hom. <hi>3.</hi> de Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preh.

But if I might have leave in this manner to apply this passage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: in the first place, where man is fallen through the weakenesse of our first Parents, we may apprehend Christ raising him up: in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place where man lyeth in the misery which sinne hath brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, we may apprehend God the Holy Ghost warning and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, with spirituall graces: in the third place, where we have the strength of man withstanding his enemies, we may apprehend the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Trinity, placing and establishing man in glory where no enemy shall be able to hurt him.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 13. The Preacher having shewed the good of society in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of private persons, now shewes it in respect of a publike person; not in regard of his authority and government, but in respect of the carefull manner of his governing: For which it is needfull that hee should have the helpfull society of others in counsell and advise: and better is one though <hi>meane</hi> that followes counsell, then another though never <hi>so great</hi> that is alone in the wilfulnesse of his owne wayes. In this sense therefore to consider the Preachers words. Great is the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and excellency of age above childhood:<note place="margin">Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexand. Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dag. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> Wherefore <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> saith, <hi>Quo magis homo festinat ad finem, tanto est vere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerabilior, ut qui Deum solum habeat se seniorem. Nam ille quo{que} est aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus senex, qui est omnibus quae sunt antiquior,</hi> By how much man draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neare to his end, by so much he is truly more venerable, as having God alone elder then himselfe. For hee is also the eternall old one, who is elder then all things that are. Great is the preeminency of a King above a poore man; and <hi>yet better is a poore and wise child,</hi> wise in being ready to heare and receive instruction and counsell, wise in being carefull to follow it, for that is the proper wisdome of a child. And well doth the Preacher joyne poverty with wisdome, for as the Philosopher speaketh, <hi>Paupertas sapientiae reparatrix,</hi> Poverty is the repairer of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in that it puts men to it, and makes them more warily and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to looke into things. And indeed they are commonly the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer children that are wise in this kind; the richer, either in pride not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:177008:64"/> suffering themselves, or by the folly of their parents, not being suffered to be ordered by counsell and instruction: and therefore <hi>Lyra</hi> sayth, <hi>Delitiosè nutriri,</hi>

                     <hi>et in delitiis vivere, impedit acquisitionem sapientiae,</hi> To be bred delicately, and to live in pleasures, doth hinder the getting of wisedome. <hi>Then an old foolish King:</hi> to be old is to adde honour and authoritie to a King; to be a King, is to adde honour and authoritie to old age: to be a foolish King, is to deprive both of their honour and authoritie. <hi>To be old,</hi> is a blessing of nature; <hi>to be a King,</hi> is a preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of favour; to be <hi>a foolish King,</hi> is to be unworthy of both. <hi>To be old,</hi> is to be Gods image; to be <hi>a King,</hi> is to be Gods substitute; to be <hi>a foolish King,</hi> is to be the Devils vassall. <hi>Who will no more be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:</hi> to refuse admonition, is in none a greater folly, than in a King, because in none it is more pernicious, to none more dangerous: but to be growne old in wilfull stubbornnesse, and selfe-conceited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse, as well as in yeares, <hi>so that he will no more be admonished,</hi> and not onely not follow it, but not heare it, as it is the extremitie of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, so it is the shame of honour, and maketh a poore wise childe better, better worthy of it. The Originall is, <hi>Qui nescit admoneri adhuc,</hi> Who knoweth not to be admonished as yet; who hath not as yet learned, though growne old, to be admonished; who hath not as yet learned the good of it in the affayres of a King.

The Preacher drawing his thoughts unto a pause, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them to that which is his generall ayme in this booke, the vanitie of humane worldly things: and having in the verse before spoken of a King made poore, he setteth downe in this verse the manner how some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it comes to passe: namely, by the defection of his people from him, by the rebellion of his Sonne against him. <hi>I have considered,</hi> sayth the Preacher: it was a thing which came into the thoughts of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> though it come not into the thoughts of a foolish King. <hi>All the living which walke under the Sunne;</hi> that is, the common people; for living and walking under the Sunne is a thing common unto all; and that he sayth, all the living is but to expresse the great number and multitude of them. <hi>With the second childe,</hi> that is, sayth <hi>Lyra, Cum filio regis, qui est secundus ab eo, eò quòd regnaturus est post eum,</hi> With the Sonne of the King, who is the second from him, because he is to reigne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him.<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> And <hi>with</hi> him the people are sayd to be, because sayth <hi>Lyra, Accidit quod senescente rege, populus &amp; maxime juvenes adhaerent filio e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus, qui pro eo est regnaturus, &amp; aliquando regnum usurpat sibi vivente pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi> It commeth to passe, that the King growing old, the people and especially the younger men (whom wee may conceive to be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially meant here by the Preacher, when he sayth, living and walking under the Sunne, because they are most lively, they are most stirring) doe adhere and cleave to his Sonne who is to reigne after him, and sometimes he usurpeth the Kingdome, his Father being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.

And first setting forth the glory of them, he expresseth a King under the Embleme of <hi>the Sunne,</hi> shewing that as the Sunne giveth life to all things, and motion to the course of things; so the King giveth life to the estates of his subjects, and motion to the proceeding of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres: so that living and walking under the Sunne shine of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they flourish in their wayes.

And because the Preacher useth this phrase, <hi>Rejoyce in him,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may imply the departing of the people in discontent from him, in regard of his hard usage, whereby he deprived the people of their joy under him.

The <hi>Iewes</hi> that offered sacrifices to God, and did not make themselves a sacrifice of God, were but fooles: and they that goe to Church, and there stay untill divine service be ended, but doe not serve God in their lives, are very fooles likewise.

                     <hi>particulam verbi,</hi> a little piece of a word, or, <hi>particulam alicujus,</hi> a little piece of something that wee doe heare of him. <hi>David</hi> sayth, What is man that God should regard him? And we may well say, what is man that he should speake or thinke of God? Take wee heed therefore that wee neither speake nor thinke rashly or hastily of him. But to listen to the Preacher, as he teacheth us to speake to God. <hi>Be not rash with thy mouth.</hi> The Preacher puts the mouth before the heart, when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the rashnesse of them, because he would not have thee to put it before the heart in the using of it. And though he call it <hi>thy mouth,</hi> yet it is not so thine, as if thou wert Lord of it, and when thou commest to speake to the Lord in prayer, mightest use it at thy pleasure: but as it is <hi>thy mouth,</hi> so let it be thy care <hi>not to be rash</hi> with it. The Originall word here is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifying <hi>turbari,</hi> to be troubled, and therefore noteth here such a hast as is in a troubled and confused manner. Doe not therefore tumble out thy words when thou speakest to God, let thy words be distinctly digested into order, understand well what thou sayest, and let others be able to understand thee. Doe not runne when thou readest, when thou prayest. It is reported, that in the Muscovy Churches, if the Minister mistake in reading, or stammer in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his words, or speake any word that is not well heard, the hearers doe much blame him, and are ready to take the booke from him as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to reade in it. And surely, God is no lesse offended with the giddy praying of many, who send their petitions in post hast unto him. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> sayth, <hi>At last I spake with my tongue,</hi> his tongue came after his heart, his words came after long looking what he would say, what he should say. And the Preacher here would not have our mouth to be first, to be first opened before our understanding be opened for the directing of it. <hi>And let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing:</hi> the heart and the mouth must be joyned together, and as there is <hi>cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in ore, ita debet esse amor in corde,</hi> an expression with the mouth, so there must be an impression of it in the heart: but yet they must not be joyned in rashnesse and hastinesse. Now the heart is hasty many wayes, either when it taketh not faith with it in praying, for unlesse faith be in the company of prayer, it will never be able to reach unto heaven: or else when it taketh not patience with it, as being contented to stay Gods leasure, untill he grant our prayers: or else when it taketh not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance with it, for God heareth not sinners:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 19.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33.</note> or else when it prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth worldly things before heavenly things, for, seeke first the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven: or else, if the heart utter any thing, before it hath

Or else the force of the reason may be thus understood; <hi>for God is in heaven,</hi> a glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, whose throne is the glorious heaven, and as <hi>Anselme</hi> speaketh, <hi>quilibet reputat Deum, id quo majus esse vel excogitari non potest,</hi> every one doth reckon God to be that, then which there can be nothing greater, nothing devised to be greater: if therefore to a great man thou wouldest not speake hastily, doe not to this great God. <hi>Thou art upon the earth:</hi> earth, made of earth, abiding upon the earth, and though thou mayest have the spirit of God, yet thou hast this treasure in an earthen vessell, and hast, may soone wrong an earthen vessell. Besides the Spirit of God, is a spirit of counsell, and wisdome: shew therefore the Spirit of God to be in thee, by being not rash with thy mouth, nor hasty in thy heart. <hi>Therefore let thy words be few:</hi> one saith well, that the mouth is the <hi>Index</hi> of the heart, and as <hi>Indices</hi> and tables doe briefly shew what is more largely handled in the bookes; so the mouth in prayer should but briefly point out to God, what is more fully enlarged in the heart. And indeed where the heart is full, either it cannot, or it careth not to be full in speaking unto God. It is a duty required, not to speake more in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then a man mindeth, and it is a thing well practised in praying to mind more than a man speaketh.

                     </note> who as <hi>Cassian</hi> relateth, <hi>utilius censent, breves quidem orationes sed creberrimas fieri: illud quidem ut frequentius Dominum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precantes, jugiter eidem adhaerere possimus: hoc verò ut insidiantis diaboli jacula, quae infligere nobis tum praecipue quum oramus insistit, succincta brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vitemus,</hi> they thinke it best, that our prayers be short but frequent: the one that praying to God we might continually be joyned unto him: the other that by shortnesse, we might avoyd the devils darts which he throweth especially at us when we are praying. Which yet is not so to be understood, as if length of praying were a thing wholly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. For as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh, <hi>Sicut intentio orandi non est ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tundenda si perdurare non potest, ita si perduraverit non cito est rumpenda,</hi> as the intention of the mind in praying is not to bee dulled and blunted if that it cannot continue; so if it doe continue, it is not suddenly to bee broken off. <hi>Absit enim ab oratione multa locutio, sed non desit multa pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio, si fervens perseverat intentio.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 3. The Preacher here compareth the folly of a busie tounge to the dreames of a busie mind, and that as the one ariseth from multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of businesse; so the other appeareth in multitude of words.<note place="margin">Tertull. de Anima. c. <hi>45.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> sheweth, that dreames are <hi>vacuae jactationes negotiosae animae,</hi> the idle tossings of a mind full of businesse: and in the idle tossing of many words, what can there be but a fulnesse of folly? How many tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, battologies are there: How many needlesse words? How often are there irreverent, unmannerly, ridiculous, if not worse passages in them? In a multitude of words there is commonly no multitude of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore the Preacher saith, <hi>that a fooles voyce is knowne by them:</hi> it is but a voyce that is heard, it is but a sound that is made, it is like the uncertaine sound of a Trumpet, so that none can tell what it meaneth, what to make of it.<note place="margin">Tertul.

If there bee any worth of matter in the multitude of words, it is but by chance,<note place="margin">Aristot. de Divin. per insomnia.</note> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith that dreames doe foretell those things which come to passe. For saith he, as when a blind man shooteth many arrowes, perhaps one may bee neere the marke; so saith hee in the multitude of dreames which passe through the head in sleepe, perhaps one may hit upon that which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out to be so: and so in the multitude of words, which passe from the mouth of some, perhaps some there may be which cary some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them. <hi>Homer,</hi>

                     <hi>Duas portas divisit somnii, corneam veritatis, eburneam fallaciae.

These dores may well be applyed unto the mouths of men, which are the dores of their minds and hearts. For to some it is a dore of glasse, which is soone broken open and easily giveth passage to a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of words, wherein the folly of their hearts and minds is discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:177008:70"/> to others it is a dore of brasse, firme and solid keeping in their words with more care and circumspection, and shewing the firme soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of their heart and mind. Wherefore when the Preacher here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the folly of many words to dreames, it is rather to be understood of the dreames of women then of men: because as <hi>folly is made knowne by multitude of words,</hi> so they are the dreames of women which are told and made knowne.<note place="margin">Chrys.

And surely a foole is like a woman in this, and as shee will bee telling her dreames, so will hee bee telling his folly by his many words.

The Preacher from the generall of speaking and praying unto God, descendeth more particularly to vowes made unto him. <hi>When thou vowest,</hi> be not rash and hasty in vowing, as <hi>Iepthe</hi> was, who sayth, Whatsoever commeth forth of the doores of my house to meete mee, shall surely be the Lords. For it might have been an asse or a dog as well as his daughter.

And first, that thou mayest not deferre, let it not be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull or unworthy thing that thou vowest, that shame doe not hold thee backe: let it not be above thy strength which thou vowest, that impossibilitie doe not stop thy way.

                     <note place="margin">Ambros. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</note> The chiefe grace of a vow is the celeritie of paying it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 5. Better it is to vow, then not to vow, and that for three reasons, as <hi>Aquinas</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> hath set them downe. First, because it is an act of divine worship, <hi>quae est praecipua inter morales virtutes,</hi> which is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest among the morall vertues.<note place="margin">Augustin. de virgin. c. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> And therefore S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Austin</hi> sayth, <hi>Non virginitas ipsa, quia virginitas, sed quia Deo dedita est honoratur,</hi> Virginitie it selfe is not so much honoured because it is virginitie, as because it is dedicated to God. Secondly, because he that vowes something and doth it, doth the more subject himselfe to God, then he that doth it onely. For he subjecteth himselfe, <hi>Non solum quantum ad actum, sed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam quantum ad potestatem,</hi> Not onely in respect of the act of doing, but also in respect of the power of doing, so that after he hath vowed, he cannot doe otherwise.<note place="margin">Anselm. l. de Similit. c. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> And therefore as <hi>Anselme</hi> sayth, <hi>Plus dat ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini qui dat arborem cum fructibus, quam qui dat fructus tantum,</hi> He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth more to a man, that giveth him the tree with the fruits, then he that giveth the fruits onely; so he giveth more to God that voweth, which is the tree, and doth it, which is the fruit, then he that doth it onely, which is the fruit onely. Thirdly, because by vowing the will is more immovably established in goodnesse. For to doe a thing out of a setled resolution unto goodnesse, belongeth to the perfection of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,<note place="margin">Aristot. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thic. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> as the Philosopher sheweth. As on the contrary, it doth much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate a sinne, to commit it out of a setled stubbornnesse. But though it be better to vow, then not to vow, yet it is better not to vow, then
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:177008:71"/> not to pay when thou hast vowed. And as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Melius est non promittere, quam promissa non facere,</hi> It is better not to promise, then not to doe the things that thou hast promised. It had been better that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had never promised to let the children of <hi>Israel</hi> goe, then not to let them goe when he had promised it. For because <hi>Pharaohs</hi> words were but an emptie sound, therefore by Gods judgement, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> noteth,<note place="margin">Ambrosius.</note>
                     <hi>Ranis impletur Aegyptus sonum inanem rerum &amp; stre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitum vanum reddentibus,</hi> was <hi>Aegypt</hi> filled with frogs, which made a great croaking, and a vast idle sound that had nothing in it. It is better to be slow in vowing, then to be slow in paying;<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> and as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh, <hi>Melius est ancipitem diu deliberare sententiam, quàm in verbis facilem, in operibus esse difficilem,</hi> It is better to deliberate, and to hold long in suspense our doubtfull resolution, then to be free and easie in our words, but hard and difficult in our works. But yet it is better to pay slowly, then not to pay at all. Although it be true as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh, <hi>Quum moramfacis, non reddis,</hi> When thou delayest to performe,<note place="margin">Ambros. de Abel et Cain l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> thou dost not performe, because so long as thou delayest to performe, so long thou dost not performe. But yet better late then never. And yet better never to vow, then never to pay it. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> tels us, <hi>Votum est postulatio bonorum à Deo, cum solvendi muneris promissione. Et ideo quum impetraveris quod petisti, ingrati est tardare promissum,</hi> A vow is an asking of some good things, with a promise of performing some dutie. And therefore when thou hast obtained that which thou diddest sue for, it is an unthankfull part to delay thy promise. But how wicked then is it, not to performe thy promise at all? <hi>An nescis quam grave sit ibi contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here peccatum, ubi speras remedium?</hi> Dost thou not know, how grievous a thing it is to make that thy sinne, which thou didst hope should have been thy comfort against sinne? Certainly, it was no small curse which the Prophet intendeth, when he sayth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 109.7.</note> Let his prayer be turned into sinne: and it is no little curse that thou bringest upon thy selfe, when thou turnest the religious vow which thou hast made into a fowle of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of an irreligious not paying of it. Good therefore it were that they who in sicknesse or any danger are ready to make vowes would consider this, that in their health and safetie they might be ready to performe them. For better it is not to vow, then to vow and not to pay.</p>

The words also in themselves may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this interpretation, Suffer not thy mouth, to give ill counsell unto thine owne children, and so to cause thy flesh to sinne. For this is a great wickednesse, and <hi>Cyrillus Alexandrinus</hi> speaking of them that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise

                     </note> for if thou shalt but suffer it, it will soone be done: because as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> speaketh, <hi>Peccatum quod per linguam admittitur, omnium fere propensis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simum, sed &amp; idem multiforme,</hi> the sinne which is committed with the mouth, is of all most ready, and withall it is of many kindes.

                     <hi>Vndique nobis diabolus insidias parare consuevit, sed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius ore peccante: nullum enim illi aeque congruum organum est in ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium interitus atque peccati,</hi> The devils manner is to lay traps for us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way, but no way so much as by a sinning tongue; for there is no part of the body so sit for the ministery of destruction and sinne. <hi>Thy flesh to sinne:</hi> that is, either thy selfe, the part being taken for the whole, or else the bodily part of thy selfe. For though thy mouth be prone to sinne, yet it cannot make thee to sinne, nor make thy body sinfull, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou suffer it. And though by thy former bad sufferance, now in a manner thou canst not choose but sinne with thy mouth, yet suffer it not to be an ordinary cause of sinning unto thee. <hi>Neither say thou before the Angel:</hi> Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> Master understood <hi>the Angel</hi> here, to be the particular Angel, which God hath appointed to waite upon every one, and the meaning to be, Doe not vow, and not performe, for thy words doe not passe away into winde, but the Angel which is thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion doth cary them forthwith unto God,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc versum.</note> and God whom thou thinkest to be ignorant of what thou hast sayd, is provoked to anger by thee, so that thy workes shall be destroyed. <hi>Tremellius</hi> understandeth here <hi>the Angel</hi> of the Covenant,<note place="margin">

But if I may deliver mine apprehension, I understand the Angel here to be the soule of man, which is of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall nature, and the meaning to be, When thou hast sinned in thy flesh, say not in thy soule, <hi>it is an errour:</hi> When thou hast sinned with thy mouth, either by thy rash praying, or by thy carelesse vowing, either delaying to performe it, or not regarding to performe it at all, say not in thy minde, excuse it not in thy soule, answer not thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:177008:72"/> which is Gods messenger to reproove thee for it, <hi>that it was an errour.</hi> The Originall word signifieth ignorance or errour, and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, that <hi>Symmachus</hi> did render the word <hi>Involuntarium,</hi> A thing unwillingly done: all which are excuses, which men pretend for not keeping of their mouths from rashnesse, and for not keeping of their vowes and promises. First, ignorance, and either they know not that they sayd it, or else they sayd they knew not what: secondly, errour, and either themselves were mistaken in that which they sayd, or else others are mistaken in understanding that which was spoken: thirdly, unwillingnesse, and either they were forced to say that which they uttered, or else they were transported by some passion, so that it was spoken against their will. The Septuagint doe reade it, <hi>Non est pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntia,</hi> say not, There is no providence: and though <hi>Tremellius</hi> doe not reade it so, yet he giveth the sense of the place according to that reading; shewing it to be thus, Say not with thy mouth, and sinne not with thy mouth, say not in thy thought before the Angel, who is the discerner of thy thoughts, that there is no providence, as if things did fall out by errour and chance. <hi>For why should God be angry at thy voyce?</hi> This wicked voyce of thine, either outwardly pronounced with thy mouth, or inwardly conceived in thine heart. Or else wherefore should God be angry with thy voyce? either thy first voyce, whereby thou hast spoken rashly, or vowed untruly: or else thy second voyce, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou addest sinne to sinne, and with more naughtie excusing seekest to helpe and palliate thy former naughtie dealing. <hi>And destroy the works of thy hands:</hi> destroy thy works, because thou hast destroyed thy words; and make thine hands to erre in doing thy works ill, because thou pretendest errour for thine ill speaking; and make thee ignorant in that which thou dost, because thou pleadest ignorance in that which thou saydst; and make thy works to perish against thy will, because thou alleagest thy words to have been against thy will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The most direct and verball translation of the words as I conceive is this, <hi>Nam in multitudine somniorum, &amp; vanitatum, &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum, multum, ideo time Deum,</hi> For in the multitude of dreames, and vanities, and words, much, therefore feare God. To make up the sense, there must be added to the word <hi>Much,</hi> much is he angry, the anger of God being that whereof the end of the former verse speaketh. And this verse being a generall conclusion to the former passage of the Chapter, wee may understand the Preacher, that many words which being full of rashnesse and folly, are but as many dreames, many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, are most offensive to God, and therefore that the feare of Gods anger should make them to be shunned. Or else in a neerenesse to a verball translation, the words may be read thus, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> hath them, <hi>In multitudine somniorum, et vanitates et verba plurima, sed time Deum,</hi> In the multitude of dreames, there are vanities and many words; but feare thou God: and then the sense,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> which as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us the <hi>Iewes</hi> gave of it, is taken from the last words; and there being,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:177008:73"/> say they, in dreames many vaine feares and many terrifying words, feare not them, but feare GOD who ruleth all things. Or else wee may understand the words with reference to the excuses, which in the former verse are forbidden, and which being but as dreames are only full of vanities and many words, and will not profit any thing: and therefore that God who knoweth all things rightly,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc versum.</note> and as <hi>Lyra</hi> speaketh, <hi>Omnia errata ad lineam justitia reducet,</hi> will reduce all errours to the line of justice, ought to be feared. But to give a translation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sense which the words may receive, they may be rendred thus, <hi>In the multitude of dreames, there is also a multitude of vanities, and in many words there is also much vanity,</hi> which in effect is the same with the translation which we read. To consider therefore this: <hi>Tertullian</hi> tels us, that <hi>Epicurus</hi> judged all dreames to be vaine, wherein diverse particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar instances both of sacred and profane histories,<note place="margin">Tertull. de Anima. c. <hi>46</hi>
                     </note> to use <hi>Tertullians</hi> phrase, <hi>Epicuro pudorem imperant,</hi> doe even force <hi>Epicurus</hi> to be ashamed, and shew the true praedictions which have beene in dreames. And as for the constitution of mans body, dreames are oftentimes good symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of it, and in that respect may be called, <hi>peculiare solatium natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis oraculi,</hi> the peculiar comfort of a naturall Oracle. On the other side the <hi>Telmessenses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Clemens Alexandri. Stromat. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> or as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> calleth them the <hi>Telmisenses</hi> and who as hee saith invented the art of divining by dreames, they saith <hi>Tertullian, Nulla somnia evacuabant,</hi> made no dreames to be vaine. But these were as farre from the truth as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and unlesse that men doe dreame in their understanding, they cannot but acknowledge that <hi>in the multitude of dreames there are many vanities.</hi> And so it is in the multitude of words. There may be some matter sometimes in some of them, but in the multitude of them there are many vanities. Let therefore <hi>the feare</hi> of Gods anger who is displeased at them, keepe thee from them. And indeed <hi>the feare of God</hi> is a most excellent meanes to doe it. For as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Chrys. Hom. <hi>15.</hi> ad popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</note>
                     <hi>Nihil tam peccata consumit, virtutem verò fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit crescere ac germinare, sicut timor,</hi> There is nothing that doth so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy sinnes, and make vertue to encrease and grow, as the feare of Gods wrath doth. And therefore he addeth, <hi>Gehenna nihil gravius, sed ejus metu nihil utilius,</hi> There is nothing more grievous then hell, but nothing more profitable then the feare of it. When our Saviour Christ was pleased to shew his terrour in the Temple, he made all the buyers and sellers to flye out of the Temple. Yea the Priests fled also, and none remained in it, as <hi>Anacletus</hi> Bishop of Rome affirmeth: which thing Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reckoneth among the chiefest of our Saviours miracles.<note place="margin">Hieronym. uper cap. <hi>21.</hi> Matth.</note> And surely the terrour and feare of Gods wrath throughly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded are able to worke miracles in calling men out of their sinnes, and in stopping them from running into them.</p>

                     <hi>custodit;</hi> as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> also rendreth it, he keepeth and preserveth.

                     </note> But <hi>mervaile</hi> not, for as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh, <hi>Non ullum Deus non dico angelorum sed vel hominum creasset, quem malum futurum esse praescisset, nisi pariter nosset, quibus eos bonorum usibus commodaret,</hi> God would not have created any I say not of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but of men, whom he foresaw that they would bee wicked, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he had foreknowne also to what good uses he would apply them. Wherefore as in the art of Rhetoricke there is a pretty elgancy from the opposition of sentences;<note place="margin">Aug. Ibid.</note> so saith the same father, <hi>Quadam non verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum sed rerum eloquentiâ, contrariorum oppositione saeculi pulchritudo compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur,</hi> By a kind of eloquence not of words, but of things, from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of contraries the beauty of the world is made and set forth: <hi>Origen</hi> therefore affirmeth,<note place="margin">Origenes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Numeros</note>

Now the word <hi>marvaile</hi> in this verse may be referred to any of these, either to the bad will and delight of the wicked in authority; or to the patient will and sufferance of God though above them in authority; or to the greatnesse and foulenesse of the matter, and wickednesse.

                     <hi>Et amplius terrae in omnibus est rex in agro culto, And moreover in all things of the earth a King in a tilled field,</hi> and applying it to God, who in the verse before is said to be above all, in these words understandeth him, to be in all things of the earth as a King in a tilled field: and that this world being unto him as a field of corne, hee doth not now alwayes punish the wicked al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee see their wickednesse, but leaving the tares and the corne to grow together, hee letteth them alone untill the day of judgement, at which time he will gather the corne into his barne, and burne the tares with fire. The most direct translation as I conceive, is that of <hi>Arias Montanus, Et praestantia terrae in omnibus rex agro fit servus,</hi> And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the earth is in all things; the King is made a servant to the field. For in the height of men it being the height of pride that maketh them to oppresse and wrong the poore, and those that are under them: the Preacher having shewed that there are higher then they by whom they are tamed, here hee addeth, that the earth it selfe is higher, and more than all, though all doe tread it under their feete: <hi>So that the King himselfe is servant, to the field.</hi> For doth he not receive his food and sustenance from the field as a servant from his master? Is not his body the livery of the earth which he weareth as a servant doth the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his master? Are not the workes of nature, the works of the earth,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:177008:75"/> and doth not a King doe them, as a servant doth the workes of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? What are the revenues of his kingdome, but as it were wages which the field payeth him, as a master payeth wages to his servant? But generally that which is understood here by interpreters is the praise of husbandry, and that in Kings themselves. The Septuagint there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore read it, <hi>Et praestantia terrae in omnibus est rex agri culti;</hi> And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the earth in all, is a King of a tilled field. The <hi>Syriack</hi> reads it, <hi>Haereditas terrae in omnibus est rex qui agrum colit,</hi> The inheritance of the earth in all things is a King who tilleth the ground. <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> reads it, <hi>Super omnes rex est dominus agrielaborati,</hi> Above all is the King, who is the master of a dressed field. Others <hi>Abundantia terrae pro omnibus rex agri agricolati,</hi> The abundance of the earth for all is the King of a field husbanded. And it is to shew the excellency of tillage that our Translation reads it: <hi>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the King himselfe is served by the field.</hi> And indeed a great honour it is to Kings to have a care of tillage.<note place="margin">Josephus Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor. l. <hi>8.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>

And here let me commend the husbandry of the earth of our bodyes, then which nothing is more excellent either for Prince or people: Let the plow of Gods Word subdue it, let the seeds of vertue bee sowne in it, and though our bodyes be earthy, let them bee made heavenly by the fruits of heavenly grace,<note place="margin">Clem.

Admonitio ad Gentes.</note> For as <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi> speaketh, <hi>Terram in coelum mutat Dei agricola,</hi> The husband-man of God turneth earth into heaven. But yet being not satisfied in the meaning of this verse, let mee propose to consideration one meaning more. For the Preacher having noted in the verse before, how the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are suffered by God in their wicked doings, here taketh away the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile of it, because it is but here upon <hi>the earth</hi> that they have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, where all things are common unto all; and because that though they bee on high, yet it is but in the favours of <hi>the earth;</hi> for <hi>the King himselfe</hi> the highest of all, hath but the priviledge to bee <hi>in a field well dressed and husbanded,</hi> whereas others are in more barren soyles. But that the right which God will doe unto the poore oppressed, and to the righteous wronged, is reserved to bee in heaven: where they shall bee
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:177008:75"/> Kings not as earthly Kings in a tilled field, but in a Kingdome of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory. Some doe here take <hi>the earth</hi> for the people of the earth, <hi>the field</hi> for the inferiour sort, because they that dresse the field are of the inferiour sort, and then whereas in the former verse is shewed the evill of those that are in higher place oppressing those that are under them, they conceive, that here an argument is given, whereby to worke contentment in it. For seeing it is needfull for the generall profit of all that there should be some on high, some under them, therefore though they on high doe abuse their places, yet that it may bee borne with, in respect of the generall benefit that ariseth from inequality of persons, in which regard even the King serveth the meanest person as having need of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 10. The Preacher shewing farther the commendation of husbandry, preferreth it before the other wealth of the world. First, because the profit of the earth satisfieth the appetite of nature feeding upon it, <hi>but silver doth not satisfie the appetite of him that loveth it.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because there is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> revenue, fruite from the earth, but he that loveth silver although he have much of it, yet hath he no fruit by it, hee enjoyeth no comfort from it. And therefore I should read the verse from the Originall thus. <hi>He that loveth silver shall not bee satisfied with silver, and he that loveth it in the multitude of it, shall not have fruit.</hi> But to consider the verse as it is in it selfe, here is a double love of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny set downe. First, a love in seeking of it before it is gotten. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a love of it when it is gotten. <hi>Hee that loveth silver, &amp;c.</hi> It is the love of silver which is the mischiefe of it, and that is to bee removed from the heart of man. Wherefore when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.27.</note> wee have forsaken all and followed thee: if we consider this All in it selfe, what could it be in such poore men, who were but fisher-men, and sustained themselves by their daily labour? But S. <hi>Greg.</hi> saith well,<note place="margin">Greg. Hom. in Matth.</note>
                     <hi>In hac re affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum debemus potius pensare quam censum. Multum relinquit qui quantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet parum totum deseruit. Multum ergo Petrus &amp; Andreas reliquerunt, quando uterque etiam desiderium habendi reliquit,</hi> In this thing we must consider rather their mind then their wealth. For he leaveth much, who leaveth all though never so little. And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> did leave much because both did leave the desire and love of having. <hi>He that loveth silver shall not bee satisfied with silver:</hi> hee that out of love seeketh after it, shall love still to seeke it, and never rest satisfied. For as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> compareth such a one,<note place="margin">Bern. Tract. de diligendo Deum c. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> he is like to one that being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hungry gapeth continually for wind, <hi>Quo inflari potest, satiari non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,</hi> with which he may be puffed up, but cannot be filled; for so, such are swolne great in pride with their wealth, but are never satisfied wi h it.

But how wretched then is he, whose will is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver satisfied, and hath his will alwayes bent and set amisse? <hi>And he that loveth abundance:</hi> it is much easier to put off the love of wealth, before a man hath it, then when hee hath it: because that which a man hath not, is not so much cared for, as being a thing not belonging to him; but when a man hath it, then it being his owne, that sets his love upon it;<note place="margin">Aquinas <hi>2. 2.</hi> Quest. <hi>86.</hi> Answ. <hi>3.</hi> Aug. Epist. ad Paulin.</note> and then as <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith, it is like the cutting off of a member from h m, for a man to part with it. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> therefore saith, <hi>Terrena di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liguntur arctius adepta quam concupita,</hi> Earthly things are loved more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly being obtained then being desired and sought for. Then it is that he loveth it as his God, setting it up in his treasury as in a Temple, or in his chest as in a shrine, and not daring himselfe to touch it as a sacred thing. So that not satisfied with <hi>the encrease,</hi> he hath <hi>no fruit</hi> in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of it. The name onely and care of a rich man, is that which such a one hath, he hath no use of his riches. He may be said to have a rich purse, but a rich minde such a one cannot have, who will hardly spare himselfe that which hee standeth in need of. Wherefore <hi>Seneca</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Seneca Epist. l. <hi>9.</hi> ep. <hi>109.</hi>
                     </note>

But especially he is said to have <hi>no fruit of his abundance,</hi> because it doth not bring forth the fruits of charity.<note place="margin">Greg. Pastor. Cur. Par. <hi>3.</hi> Adm. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </note> For as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Fructus ex eis caperetur, si eas bene spargere non amando voluisset.

But hee that loving them doth keepe them shall leave them without fruit. And no marvell if sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and abundance of riches doe not satisfie the soule of man, for as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaking to God saith,<note place="margin">Aug.

                     </note>
                     <hi>Facta est anima rationalis capax Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine majestatis tuae, ut à te solo &amp; nullo alio possit impleri,</hi> The reasonable soule is made capable, O Lord of thy Majesty, that by thee alone and nothing else it may be filled.<note place="margin">Bern.

                     </note> And Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> therefore saith also well, <hi>Anima rationalis caeteris omnibus occupari potest, impleri non potest,</hi> The reasonable soule may be busied about other things, but it cannot be filled with them. The Preacher therefore concludeth, <hi>This is also vanity.</hi> This is not the good of man, for to that two things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, first <hi>Vt sit bonum habenti,</hi> That it be good unto him that hath it; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Vt terminet ejus appetitum,</hi> That it terminate and set an end unto his desire: but this riches doe not, being the care and torment of him that hath them, and without fruit of comfort, and leaving his desire unsatisfied,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> as if hee had them not. But this is therefore vanity, and though it bee <hi>silver,</hi> although it be <hi>abundance of silver,</hi> it is a thing of nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 11. The Preacher having preferred the wealth of the field,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:177008:76"/> before the wealth of money; yet here sheweth the wealth of the field to be vaine also, because when the <hi>good fruits of the earth are encreased, they are encreased also that doe eate them.</hi> For more being needfull for the sowing, reaping, ordering of them, there are the more mouths to devoure them.<note place="margin">Arabica versio.</note> This sense the Arabick translation makes to be most proper, for that reads it, <hi>In multitudine panis, multi &amp; qui comedunt eum,</hi> In the multitude of bread, many there are also that doe eate it. And to shew the vanitie of this, the Preacher addeth, <hi>What good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?</hi> What good doth that doe the owners, which is eaten by others? What nourishment have they by it, save onely the feeding of their eyes? He that is the Master may please his eyes in beholding many to be fed with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision; but as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc versum.</note>
                     <hi>Plus quam unius hominis cibum ipse capere non potest,</hi> More then the sustenance of one man himselfe cannot receive. Or else wee may consider that the Preacher having shewed the vanitie of riches in the covetous wretch that doth not use and enjoy them; here he speaketh of them as they are made use of. And then we may take his words either in a good or in a bad sense. First, in a bad sense: <hi>When goods encrease,</hi> and men have much to spend, <hi>they are encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that eate them;</hi> they will have many about them, they will keepe a great retinue, and shew the greatnesse of their estates, by the great number that are fed by them. But what more vaine then this? For what good is there to the Masters of them? What are they for the most part, but as <hi>Lyra</hi> speaketh, <hi>Inutiles &amp; ribaldi,</hi> uselesse, needlesse,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc versum. Nah. <hi>3.17.</hi>
                     </note> and ribaldry fellows. Of whom wee may understand the Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> to speake, when he sayth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Coronantur,</hi> crowned they are as Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs, that is, those by whom they are crowned and compassed about are but as Locusts, and as Locusts doe onely devoure the fruits of the earth, so doe they onely devoure meate and drinke. <hi>What good is there therefore to the Masters of them, save the beholding of them with his eyes?</hi> The beholding of so many to be their servants, to waite upon them, and to follow after them.<note place="margin">Olympiodor. in hunc vers.</note> This sense the reading of <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> doth seeme to countenance, who hath it thus, <hi>Principatus enim est illi ut videat oculis suis,</hi> For it is a principalitie to his vaine minde, and he thinketh himselfe a little King to behold it with his eyes. Or else the Preachers words may be taken in a good sense thus. Although some be so base, that they will not spare a little out of their superfluitie to relieve others; yet they that are good, <hi>when their goods are encreased,</hi> will doe good with them, and they whom their charitie feedeth, shall <hi>be encreased also.</hi> But then the latter part of the verse must be read, either as the Syriack hath it, <hi>Et factum est, foelix possidentibus se,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Syriaca ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio.</note>
                     <hi>quoniam de capite meo vidiocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis meis,</hi> And it becommeth a happinesse to them that enjoy themselves, because from mine head I have seene it with mine eyes. Or else as the Venetian translation hath it, <hi>Et quid gratius esse poteritidomino ejus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Veneta versio</note>
                     <hi>quàm videre hoc ipsum oculis suis,</hi> And what can be more acceptable to the owner of it, then to behold this very thing with his eyes? to behold
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:177008:77"/> so many blessing God, and praying for him, by whom they are relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But the Originall word which I finde in the Hebrew being <gap reason="foreign">

His substance being shewed to be great, the great number of his household is shewed also, as being needfull for it. But besides, <hi>Quid rectum dominis suis,</hi> What is right to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, then that with their eyes they behold and looke to their servants, and see that they governe themselves well, and that they be not idle. <hi>Abraham</hi> had so great a family,<note place="margin">

Now thus to looke to the well managing of a great estate, to the well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of a great family, being no little toyle and vexation of spirit, well sheweth the vanitie of worldly goods, even in them that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,<note place="margin">Bernar.

Yea, <hi>it is a sweet sleepe unto him:</hi> his sleepe is to him as the sweet sound of still musick, all his senses being joyned in an unison of rest: his sleepe is to him a sweet moysture, which distilling from the hony-combe of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, dulleth the appetite of watchfulnesse, and withall nourisheth his strength, to make him able to watch the better.

In which this also is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that if riches being kept, are kept to the hurt of man, then how much greater is the hurt to which they are heaped up?

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:177008:80"/> lets him out: it lets him in <hi>naked</hi> as leaving him to himselfe, it lets him out <hi>naked</hi> as making him to leave all that he hath behind him. Some it lets in, and followes still through their whole life, even till it lets them out againe. And although some it leave for a time, yet oftentimes it meets with them againe. Yea even he doth sometimes fall upon it, who is most carefull to drive it away, and thinketh himselfe to bee farthest from it. The best way therefore is so to shunne it, as not to be afraid to meet it: not by a carelesse negligence to lye naked to the assaults of it, and yet not to bee disquieted with vexing impatiency, if it strip a man of all, and leave him naked, as he <hi>came forth of his mothers wombe.</hi> It is St. <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> question upon the like words of <hi>Iob.

And whither doth he returne? Of <hi>Iob Cl. Alexandrinus</hi> saith, <hi>Revertitur ad locum ubi Deus est verus pater &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nostra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Clem. Alex. Catena Gr.</note> He returneth to the place where God is, who is our true Father and Mother both.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:177008:80"/> doing no good in it, hee is also sent away as he came.

For the hand being the instrument of giving, the Preacher useth this phrase to expresse a giving. Nothing therfore hath he to give nothing to his children, nothing to give to his frinds, or kindred, nothing to give to the poore, that though at last, yet by shewing mercy to the distressed he might find mercy with God. Charity is most acceptable to God, when it is shewed to the poore in the time of health and life; but I will not deny it acceptance with God even in death also.

And though they bee dayes to him,

He hath none that eareth with him; that would bee too much light to witnesse his basenesse.

Thirdly, his owne much <hi>sicknesse</hi> is the vexing malady of his owne tormenting care,<note place="margin">Chrys. Hom. <hi>14.</hi> in <hi>1<seg rend="sup">am</seg>
                        </hi> ad Corinth.</note> and this is such a sicknesse, that Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaking of it saith, <hi>Fugiamus ergo hunc morbum, fugiamus hanc gehennam, est enim gehenna cupiditas

This is the fourth time that the Preacher hath set downe this sentence, and seeing he repeateth it so often, wee have reason to regard it the more. <hi>Behold:</hi> That which the Preacher had beheld in the world, he bids us to behold in this verse: that which he had seene and looked into, and upon sight, in his judgement approoved to be true, that he proposeth to our sight, judgement, and approbation.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>It is good:</hi> S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Peter</hi> sayd, It is good to be here, when he was with <hi>Christ</hi> upon the mountaine, but the Spirit of God noteth, that he wist not what he sayd.

It is good therefore for every one to consider what he sayth, and to see into it, as here the Preacher doth, before he say of it, It is good. <hi>It is good,</hi> good, but unto them that are good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will doe it in a good manner. <hi>And comely:</hi> So that a man doth not destroy his owne comelinesse by it, doth not by eating and drinking make himselfe a beast, doth not by rejoycing make himselfe a foole, and make the devill sport. <hi>Comely</hi> it is,<note place="margin">Bernard. in Canti.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:177008:83"/> And seeing the Preacher sayth, <hi>It is good,</hi> I know not why any one should say,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>it is bad.</hi> The exposition of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> upon these words is this, that it is good, <hi>Ad comparationem ejus, qui opibus suis in cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum tenebris vescitur,</hi> In comparison of him, of whom the verse before speaketh, that feedeth on his riches in the darknesse of cares. And the reason which he addeth, is very proper, <hi>Hic enim voluptas parva est in fruendo, ibi vero solicitudinum tantummodo magnitudo,</hi> For here is some little pleasure in enjoying, but there is onely a greatnesse of cares. But to proove it also in it selfe to be good, the Preacher addeth, <hi>It is good to enjoy the good:</hi> now it cannot but be good to enjoy good. Then <hi>good</hi> it is, the good of this life, but not the good of man, not the good for which man was created. The <hi>good</hi> it is which man may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, but not the good on which man must set his heart: the <hi>good</hi> it is which the earth affordeth, but which in comparison of heaven is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evill than good. <hi>Of all his labour:</hi> if the good be, but the hire of hard labour, let a man enjoy that, that he may be the better enabled to labour: if the good be the benefit of more gainefull labour, let a man be the more free in enjoying of it. <hi>All labour</hi> is not the same, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath all labour the same successe, but what the successe is, that let a man enjoy. <hi>That he taketh under the Sunne:</hi> Let his life see the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of that, which under the Sunne he hath seene how to get; let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also in a carefull and wise manner, see how God hath blessed his labour under the Sunne: let him not eate in darknesse and solitary sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfulnesse, that which he hath laboured for under the Sunne. <hi>All the dayes of his life:</hi> the Originall is, the number of the dayes of his lifes. First, <hi>the number of his dayes,</hi> for mans life is but a number, and as in number, there is a perfect end every where, in two as well as in three, in three as well as in foure; so in mans life there may be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect end every where, this day as well as to morrow, and to morrow as well as next day: and in all, man is but a day-labourer under the Sunne. Secondly, it is sayd, of his <hi>lifes,</hi> (to make use of that though it be an Hebraisme:) for there is the life of youth, the life of manhood, the life of age, and to every life there belongeth a different manner of enjoying the good of his labour, as well as a different kinde of labour is proper unto each of them. <hi>Which God giveth him:</hi> it is God which maketh up the number of mans dayes for him; so long as he addeth his supportance, they continue; when he subtracteth the stay of his hand, they are ended presently. If he give bountifully, our dayes are many; if he be sparing to give, our dayes are few and quickly gone. <hi>For it is his portion:</hi> his portion in this earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> which GOD hath set out for him: his portion which his labour hath gotten and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed. But it is but a portion, but a small portion onely of that which is provided for him; and therefore let every one so enjoy this, as that he be carefull not to lose the other: let every one so husband this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that he may finde the encrease of it in the Kingdome of glory in Heaven.</p>

                     <hi>Iubetur Moyses astante Deo percutere petram, ne gratia tanti beneficii homini &amp; non Deo tribuatur, Moyses</hi> is commanded, God being present, to strike the rocke, least the favour of so great a benefit should be ascribed to man and not to God. And surely, God it is who maketh the streame of wealth and riches to abound to every one: though the diligence and care of man be imployed, yet it is God who standeth by, and maketh the waters to flow. The rich therefore in estate must be poore in spirit; for so <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hilarius.</note> expoundeth the poore in spirit, <hi>Qui nihil quicquam suum esse, nihil proprium, sed cuncta dono parentis unius tribui agnoscunt,</hi> Who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge nothing at all to be theirs, nothing to be proper to themselves, but all things to be given by one Father, even the Father of lights,<note place="margin">

This is that which the Preacher teacheth <hi>every man to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eate thereof.</hi> He that hath meate in his mouth, hath not power to eate it, unlesse God doe give it unto him: without God wee are not able to doe any thing. The French translation doth reade this very well, <hi>Dont il le fait mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre pour en manger,</hi> whereof he is made Master to eate of it. For the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous wretch is not master of his owne wealth;<note place="margin">Ambros. de Nabut. c. <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note> but as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh, <hi>Non tam possessor est divitiarum quam ab eis possidetur,</hi> Is not so much a possessour of his riches, as rather is possessed by them. He therefore doth not <hi>eate</hi> of his riches, that is, doth not make use of them for his necessary occasions. And surely, this is not done, unlesse God doe <hi>give</hi> it, and <hi>give a power</hi> to doe it. For there be powers that doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist men in it, even the powers of darknesse in their malice outwardly, and in the strong power of mans owne corruption inwardly. <hi>And to take his portion:</hi> that is, sayth <hi>Olympiodorus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Olympiodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note>
                     <hi>Qui futurae foelicitatis partem hic aliquam fruitionemque accepit,</hi> Who here hath some part and fruition of his future happinesse. And indeed to them who serve God in their wealth, their riches are but the first part, and the least part of that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse which afterwards God will bestow upon them. But <hi>to take his portion</hi> here, I understand to be, to take contentment in his portion, to be satisfied with it, and not with greedinesse of minde never to have enough. The Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> speaking of the covetous <hi>Israelites,</hi> sayth, Their land is full of silver and gold: their land, their purses, not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And so it is with many, to whom God doth not give a heart <hi>to take their portion</hi> with contentment. <hi>And to rejoyce in his labour.</hi> The Chaldee Paraphrase applyeth this joy unto heaven, where it is,<note place="margin">Chald. Pard.</note> that true joy is to be had: and accordingly giving the sense of the whole verse it selfe, <hi>Omnis quoque homo cui dedit Deus divitias &amp; substantiam, &amp; potestatem, dedit ei Deus ut comedat ex eo in hoc saeculo, &amp; ut faciat ex eo eleemosynam, &amp; ut recipiat mercedem perfectam patris sui in saeculo venturo et gaudeat in labore suo cum justis,</hi> Every man also to whom God hath

But to understand the joy of this life, <hi>to rejoyce in his labour,</hi> is beyond the supplying of necessaries which nature requireth, even to delight himselfe, and to give himselfe a recompence of fitting pleasure for the paines of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc versum.</note>
                     <hi>This is the gift of God.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 20. It is the solicitous care of mans heart for the things of this life, that in a great measure maketh his life miserable unto him. The Preacher therefore speaking here of one that leadeth a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, sayth, <hi>He shall not much remember:</hi> not much, and yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for he must not be carelesse, not wholy negligent in looking to the affayres of his life.<note place="margin">Gregor.

                     </note> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> therefore noteth well, <hi>Quia solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos nos esse veritas in crastinum prohibet, habere utcunque curam in praesenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus non negat,</hi> Because the truth forbiddeth us to take care for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he doth not deny but that wee may take care for the present. Not too little, as well as not much is the rule of Wisedome and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>He shall not much remember the dayes of his life:</hi> Sorrow shall not make him thinke the dayes of his life to be too many, nor calling to minde how bad they have beene which he hath past, to wish that they may be few which are to come, nor complaining as shee doth in the Poet; <hi>Cur mortis adempta est conditio? Possem tantos finire dolores,</hi> Why is the condition of death taken away from me? I might make an end of these so many griefes. But I rather take the meaning of the words to be this, He shall not much thinke, nor be troubled in his minde, how to provide for the dayes of his life, he shall not loose the comfort of the present dayes, by being solicitous for the dayes to come. The foole in the Gospel, who was much troubled with pulling downe and building up, <hi>Longos annorum ambitus, spei vanitate in horreis simul inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debat,</hi> Did shut up all at once in his barnes, the long circuits of many

It is for this day, not for dayes, that our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> doth teach us to pray.

Doth not one divine will of God sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply food unto them all? So <hi>Gregory Nyssene. Because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.</hi> This translation supposeth a question to be made, and indeed it is a common question in solicitous worldly hearts, <hi>Quid faciam?</hi> What shall I doe? What shall I doe the next yeare? What shall I doe in mine old age? What shall I doe all the dayes of my life? The rich foole in the Gospel, making this question in the Gospel, <hi>Chrysologus</hi> would know who it is to whom he speaketh,<note place="margin">Chrysologus, Serm. <hi>104.</hi>

But here God answereth, and that the question might not be asked, he answereth before hand, by giving a joyfulnesse and cheerefulnesse of heart, which relying upon Gods providence and goodnesse, is not troubled with such vexation of thoughts.

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:177008:86"/> Preacher doth so often say it: When our Saviour wept, <hi>Lazarus</hi> being dead,<note place="margin">Hieronym.</note> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>Doluit Lazarum non dormientum, sed potius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surgentum, &amp; flebat quem cogebatur propter salvandos alios ad saeculum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocare, hanc vitam dans Dominus ingemiscebat,</hi> He lamented <hi>Lazarus</hi> not sleeping, but rather rising againe, and he wept for him, whom he was constrained for the salvation of others, to bring backe into the world, giving him this life he groaned.<note place="margin">Concilium <hi>4<seg rend="sup">m</seg>.</hi> Toleta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> And so the fourth Councell of <hi>Toledo, Non ploravit Lazarum mortuum, sed ad hujus vitae aerumnas resuscitandum,</hi> He wept not for <hi>Lazarus</hi> being dead, but because he was to be raised to the miseries of this life againe. And surely, as it is easie to see the evils of this life, so it is not easie to keepe the eyes from teares in the seeing of them. <hi>Which I have seene:</hi> the Preacher was diligent in looking into the evils of mans life: and surely, it is good to see and consider them, that so wee may the more rightly judge of this life, and may bee the more willing to leave it, and to goe to a better.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 2. In my meditations upon this passage of the Preacher, the rich man in the Gospell hath often come into my mind: but here mee thinkes the two Preachers doe handle the same Text, and that which here the Preacher of Israel delivereth by way of doctrine, the Preacher of the Vniversall Church doth there exemplifie by a parable. The rich man there, is here <hi>a man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour:</hi> which words <hi>Lyra</hi> doth thus distinguish,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc versum.</note> by riches under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>artificiales divitas, aurum &amp; argentum,</hi> artificiall riches, gold and silver, by wealth understanding <hi>naturales divitias,</hi> naturall riches, as corne and other fruits of the earth, by honour understanding, <hi>statum honorificum</hi> a great and glorious estate. But to take them altogether, it is God that giveth them. For as the Psalmist speaketh,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.4.</note> In his hand are all the deepe places of the earth, all the deepe mines of gold and silver are in his hand, and as <hi>Chrysologus</hi> speaketh, <hi>Quae in manu Dei sunt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chrysologus Serm. <hi>46.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>sine Deo nequeunt obtineri,</hi> Those things which are in Gods hand cannot bee obtained without God. Our Saviour Christ speaketh also of the riches which the earth bringeth forth, and which in a more evident manner are the gift of God to man. <hi>So that he wanteth nothing for his soule:</hi> that is, <hi>animae concupiscenti</hi> his desiring soule, for so the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth. <hi>Of all that hee desireth:</hi> this is to bee understood in his owne thoughts and imagination,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19.</note> according as the rich foole in the Gospell said to his soule, soule thou hast much goods layd up for many yeeres, take thine ease, eate, drinke, and be merry, <hi>Migraturae mox animae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita satis longa praeparaus,</hi> providing for his soule which was presently to be gone away things laid up for a long time. And wee may marke in both places, how both are for their owne souls, for their own desires: they who have so much for themselves have nothing for the poore soules of others. Others may begge and desire in their wants and necessities, but nothing is granted, to supply their wants, to satisfie their desires. <hi>Humanus agerinhumanum dominum sustinebat,</hi> A kind and liberall field in bringing forth fruit,<note place="margin">Chrysologus Serm. <hi>104.</hi>
                     </note> sustained an unkind and miserable master, saith <hi>Chrysologus</hi> of him in the Gospell: and here a gracious and bountifull God giveth riches, and wealth and honour, to an ungracious and wretched man, who will give nothing to others that stand in need
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:177008:87"/> of his helpe. But therefore <hi>God doth not give him power to eate of it,</hi> that is, his life is cut off, the powers of darknesse doe take away his soule, according as in the Gospell it is said,<note place="margin">Luk. <hi>12.20.</hi> Chrysologus Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>Hac nocte repetunt animam tuam,</hi> This night they require thy soule of thee. Where <hi>Chrysologus</hi> noteth, <hi>Sanctorum animas Deus repetit, &amp; reducit; tartarei ministri repetunt &amp; pertrahunt animas impiorum,</hi> God requireth the soules of the righteous, and taketh them backe to himselfe who gave them; but the ministers of hell require the soules of the wicked and dragge them away. Thus the rich foole <hi>horreorum suorum seras negando aliis, sibi conclusit;</hi> by barring up his barnes, and denying reliefe to others did shut them up to himselfe, and had not power to eate thereof: thus he who wanted as he thought nothing for his soule that he could desire, wanted his soule, and that was taken from him, when so much wealth was given him. <hi>But a stranger eateth it:</hi> and whereas it is said in the Gospell, then whose shall these things bee,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc versum.</note> which thou hast provided? that is saith <hi>Lyra, Quasi diceret, alieni habebunt,</hi> As if he should say, strangers shall have them. So that as <hi>Chrysologus</hi> speaketh, <hi>Est alienorum custos, qui esse suorom noluit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogator, ingratus Deo, sibi nequam,</hi> He is but the keeper of the things of strangers, who will not be a charitable dispenser of his own, unthankfull to God, pernicious to himselfe. And is not this <hi>then a vanity and an evill disease?</hi> A vanity of the world, and an evill disease of humane nature. For though the man be dead, it is but an evill disease of the corrupted nature of man, to which it is subject, and whereof it is sicke. Many particular men are taken away by it: and they that are living, may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in see the infirme frailty of humane condition. When men have plenty and flourish in abundance, they promise to themselves long joy, much delight, even all that their soule desireth; but then doth God take away their lifes,<note place="margin">Chrysologus Ibid.</note> and as <hi>Chrysologus</hi> speaketh of him in the Gospell, <hi>Sic praeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est, ut magis cogitata perderet, quam bona,</hi> Hee was so prevented, that he might rather loose his thoughts then his goods; in like manner then doth God cut off the lives of many, as well to shew them the vanity of their thoughts, as to shew them and others the vanity of mans estate on earth.<note place="margin">Olympiodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus in hunc versum.</note>
                     <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> applying this verse in a morall sense, tels us, <hi>Saepe accidit, ut aliquis magnas sibi divitias in dicendi copia &amp; in scientia Scriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum comparavit, aliarum{que} rerum cognitione, sed quia deinde foeditas morum à verbis suis dissidet ac doctrina; hinc fit ut qui in libros illius traditiones{que} incidunt, magnam inde ipsi quidem utilitatem capiant, nihil vero ipse autor emolumenti perceperit,</hi> Oftentimes it commeth to passe, that some one hath gotten to himselfe a great fluency of speech, and a great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the knowledge of the Scriptures and of other things; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the lewdnesse of his manners departeth and disagreeth both from his words and doctrine, hence it is that they who meete with his books and instructions, doe gather from them much profit to themselves, but the author himselfe reapeth no benefit from them. One thing more let me note, which the earnestnesse of my thoughts passed by: and that is the difference betweene devouring or swallowing, and eating: for
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:177008:87"/> none devoure or swallow more then covetous wretches; <hi>but God doth not give them power to eate it,</hi> so that it is not turned into the nourishment of any comfort to them. And what is that but a vanitie of feeding? What is that but an evill disease of an ill tempered and ordered sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 3. But put case sayth the Preacher, that <hi>a stranger doth not eate of it,</hi> and that himselfe <hi>beget an hundred children,</hi> whereof it is likely, that some will outlive him, to have his estate and wealth after him: and put case that his life be not taken away, but that <hi>he liveth many yeares,</hi> even as many more as he begetteth children, and that <hi>the dayes of his yeares</hi> be exceeding many; yet if being filled with yeares, if being filled with children, <hi>his soule be not filled with good,</hi> with the good of contentment in that which he hath, with the good of comfort in expecting a reward for that which he hath done: <hi>and also that he have no buriall:</hi> to take these words to signifie no more, then the reproach of not being bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> denounced against <hi>Iehojakim,</hi> saying, <hi>that he should be buryed with the buriall of an Asse,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iere.</hi> 22.19.</note> should be cast forth to rot above ground, is to bury the force and worth of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers meaning. And yet how to lay it open well, is not a thing of easie worth. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> giveth diverse interpretations of it; as, first,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc. vers.</note> that he doth not thinke of his buriall, thinke of his death, but because he hath lived many yeares, and hath much layd up for many yeares more, therefore hath no buriall in his minde, hath no remembrance of his death to be ready for it. Or secondly, <hi>hath no buriall,</hi> that is, his covetous heart, which hath gathered so much in his life, will not allow any thing at his death to be spent upon his buriall, will not spare any thing to the building of a Sepulchre for himselfe. Or, thirdly, <hi>hath no buriall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause being assaulted and murdered for his wealth, his wealth is taken from him, and no buriall is given to him. Or lastly, which S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> approoveth best, because he hath done no good nor worthy thing, whereby to preserve his memory among posteritie, and not to suffer his life to passe away in silence as a beast, whereas he had enough, and might have done enough, whereby it might have appeared, that he had lived. To these let me adde some other expositions which I have thought upon. As first, <hi>he hath no buriall,</hi> that is, there is no mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor lamentation for him, but as he did no good while he lived, so no one is sorry that he is dead. Or secondly, <hi>he hath no buriall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause although dead, yet he is as it were not dead,<note place="margin">Salv. contrà Avaritiam lib. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Et quum Deus jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serit viventem opibus renuntiare, ille eas cupit in liberis &amp; cognatis suis etiam mortuus possidere,</hi> And when God commandeth the living to renounce his riches, he being dead desire still to possesse them in his children and kindred, leaving all to them, as <hi>Salvianus</hi> speaketh.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:177008:88"/> nam{que} &amp; stultus amor est, alterius memor, &amp; sui immemor,</hi> That your children are neere and deare unto you is a certaine thing, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve me, there is none more neere and deare unto you then your selves: love therefore, we forbid you not, love your children, but in a second degree to your selves, doe you so love them, as that you be not seene to hate your selves. It is an unadvised and foolish love, which is mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of others,<note place="margin">Nazianzene Orat. <hi>2.</hi> in Pasch.</note> but forgetfull of himselfe. Wherefore as <hi>Nazianzene</hi> speaketh, when yee goe out of Aegypt, take something with you, leave not all to them, who perhaps <hi>Scelerate quaesita sceleratius consument,</hi> will consume more wickedly those things which were wickedly gotten. Shew thy selfe to be dead, by giving something to pious uses, <hi>that so thou mayst bee buried.</hi> Or else <hi>he hath no buriall,</hi> because although men doe give him buriall, yet God doth not. God taketh care of the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of his servants, he taketh order for their buriall: and therefore hee saith to <hi>Iacob</hi> going downe to Aegypt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 46.4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.13.</note> I will surely bring thee up againe: which he did when <hi>Iacob</hi> was dead, bringing up his dead body to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the Sepulcher of his fathers. But as for the wicked, God doth not bury them, he doth not lay them up in his Cabinet, untill hee shall bring them forth againe in the glorious Resurrection. The covetous wretch hath no buriall from God, for God is not left his heire, God is not left his executour, God is not made Overseer of his will: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to them to looke to that and to doe it, God was not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred at all by him, God therefore looketh not after him. But what a wrong is this to God? Is not hee the true master of all mens estates? What are we all but <hi>possessores usufructuarii,</hi> possessours only of the use of that which we have?<note place="margin">Salvianus contra Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritiam. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> Wherefore as <hi>Salv.</hi> speakes, <hi>tenuimus quoad licuit, tenuimus quoad permisit ille qui praestitit, quid rectius? quid honestius? quam ut ubi res ab eo discedit, qui usum habuit, revertatutr ad eum possessio, qui uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum concessit,</hi> we have had our estates as long as we could, we have had it, as long as he pleased who lent it unto us, what is more right? what more honest? then that whereas the estate goeth from him who had the use of it, the possession doe returne to him, who granted it to bee used. But as for him who thus dying <hi>hath no buryall,</hi> hath not God to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him, the Preacher pronounceth of him, <hi>I say that an untimely birth is better than hee: I say,</hi> hee that gave his wise judgement of the two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the one living the other dead, doth here give his judgement of an untimely birth, and an untimely death. For death is alwaies untimely unto a covetous wretch, hee is alwayes unwilling to part with his riches, and hee is never ready and fit to depart out of the flesh: Now justly is the untimely birth preferred. For the one comming too soone into the world comes not at all; the other being not fit to goe out of the world, when he is gone is fit only for torments in hell. The one delivered from the miseries of this life, commeth not nere the sorrowes of the next; the other having made this miserable life more miserable to himselfe by his wretched covetousnesse, doth make hell even covetous and greedy to devoure him. Where his punishment shall never be filled up, as here
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:177008:88"/> his heart was not with the things of this world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 4. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> speaking unto man, sayth,<note place="margin">Bernard. Ser. de primord. med. &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viss. Augustin. l. cui tit. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note>

Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> also speaking unto man, sayth, <hi>Intelligar ergo in quantum sit ingressus tuus flebilis, progressus tuus debilis, et egressus tuus horribilis,</hi> Vnderstand therefore how lamentable thy comming is, how feeble thy going on is, how terrible thy going out is. It is the like manner of expressing himselfe, and of setting out mans misery and condition which here the Preacher useth. <hi>He commeth in with vanitie:</hi> with the vanitie of Originall corruption, <hi>and departeth in darknesse,</hi> in the darknesse of his actuall transgressions. For these are darknesse indeed, by which the light of Gods favour is darkened and kept from us, the light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is darkned and shut up in us, by which the darknesse of eternall misery is brought upon us. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> noteth, <hi>Non dicit Deus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Augustin. in Psal. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>fiant tenebrae, et factae sunt, et tamen tenebras ordinavit, et divisit à luce tenebras,</hi> God did not say, Let there be darknesse, and there was darknesse, but yet God ordered the darknesse, and divided the darknesse from the light: it is so with the transgressions of men, God never sayd, Let them be, but having their being from man, he ordereth them, and by his justice divideth them from the light of happinesse. But here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sayd of the covetous wretches life; his vaine comming in, his darke going out mentioned; wee reade nothing of his wretched life, as if that were not worthy to be remembred. And indeed, it followes, <hi>His name shall be covered with darknesse.</hi> Whereby is not meant onely, that his name shall be forgotten, for then it had been enough to have sayd, <hi>his name shall be covered.</hi> But seeing it is added, that <hi>his name shall be covered with darknesse,</hi> it is meant that the foulenesse and blacknesse of his actions, shall make his name to be as a thing abhorred to be thought upon. And surely, when vanitie lets him in, and darknesse shuts him out, what could it be but wretchednesse that kept him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the meane while? But it seemeth to me that the Originall here may not amisse be translated, <hi>He commeth into vanitie, and goeth into darknesse.</hi> First, he commeth into vanitie:<note place="margin">Ambros. in Psal. <hi>118.</hi> Octon. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> shewing the vanitie of mans life, and that it is but a shadow, telleth us, that when the Sonne of God was borne of the Virgin, it is sayd, that the power of the highest overshadowed her, <hi>Quia in umbram descendit, ab umbra in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiens operari salutem hominis, et consummaturus claritate solis aeterni,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he descended into a shadow, from a shadow beginning to worke the salvation of man, which he will finish in the brightnesse of the eternall Sunne.<note place="margin">Ambros. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</note> And the same Father considering the words of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I will live and keepe thy words;</hi> thereupon noteth, <hi>Vivam ait, quasi nondum vivens; hic enim in umbra vivimus. Ergo vita ista in corpore, umbra est vitae, et imago, non veritas,</hi> He sayth, I will live, as not living yet, for here wee live in a shadow. This life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:177008:89"/> in the body, is a shadow and an image of life, not the truth of it.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 5. The Preacher having shewed in the former verse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the covetous wretch, here he sheweth the condition of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive childe, and from the sight of both confirmeth his sentence, that the abortive childe is in better condition. For as <hi>he hath not seene the Sunne,</hi> so neither hath he seen the miseries that are under the Sunne, neither hath the Sunne seene his sorrow and labour in the enduring of them. His eye hath not beheld the glory of the Sunne, and the Sunne which is the eye of the world, hath not beheld the wretchednesse of his life.<note place="margin">Ambros.

                     </note> It is true, that the Sunne is <hi>Iucunditas diei, coeli pulchritudo, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae gratia, praestantia creaturae,</hi> The sweetnesse of the day, the beauty of heaven, the grace of nature, the excellency of the creature, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> speaketh: but yet as the same Father addeth, <hi>Non te tanto splendori Solis temere committas,</hi> Commit not thy selfe rashly to so great a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Sunne. I have read of some, who when the Sunne riseth, doe curse it alwayes, in respect of the scorching heate of it, and when it goeth downe,<note place="margin">Ambros.

Wherefore the good of the Sunne hath evils also with it; and so many are the evils of mans life under it, that rather then to suffer the darknesse of them, it is better not to enjoy the light of the Sunne. But if he that shall see the Sunne of the heavens, shall not have his eye upon the Sunne of righteousnesse, to walke in his wayes: surely much better were it for him, not to have seene the Sunne at all.

It is true, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh; <hi>Scire bonum, melius est quam nescire, &amp; ei qui bonum scit, pulchrum est etiam scire quod malum est; ut sciat pravum vitare, &amp; ut prudens lubeat custodiae cautionem,</hi> It is better to know good, then not to know it, and to him that knoweth good, it is a gracefull thing to know also what is evill, that so he may know to shun the evill, and being wise may be cautelous to keepe himselfe from it.<note place="margin">Ambros. de Paradiso. c. <hi>7.</hi>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:177008:92"/> using to this purpose the speech of the rich glutton who desired a drop of water to coole his tongue, he saith, <hi>Infidelis populus verba legis in ore tenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, quae opere servare contempsit: ibi ergo amplius ardebit, ubi se ostendit scire quod facere noluit.</hi> The unfaithfull people had the words of the Law in their mouthes, which they despised to observe in their actions: there therefore shall they burne the more, where they shewed that they knew,<note place="margin">Cassian Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. <hi>14.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi>

                     </note> which reason ordereth unto immortality, as <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus</hi> speaketh. <hi>A wise man</hi> affecteth not delicacy and daintinesse of feeding, as knowing <hi>Deum parasse opificio suo, homini inquam, cibum &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, ut conservetur, non ut voluptate afficiatur,</hi> That God hath provided for his workmanship, namely man, meate and drinke to preserve him, not to affect him with pleasure. A wise man is moderate in his feeding, as knowing, <hi>Quae sunt secundum naturam appetitiones circumscribi suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia,</hi> The appetites, which are according unto nature to bee bounded with sufficiency: Whereas he that is <hi>a foole</hi> in feeding, and made a foole by feeding, <hi>Habet constupratum gustum misera &amp; infausta condiendi arte &amp; inani in faciendis bellariis artificio,</hi> Hath his tast adulterated with a wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and unlucky art of seasoning, and with a vaine skill in making of junckets,<note place="margin">Clem.

Wherefore hee addeth, <hi>Mihi quidem morbi eorum misereri lubet; ipsos autem non pudet suas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantare delitias,</hi> I am moved to pitty their disease, although themselves bee not ashamed to extoll their delicates. <hi>A foole</hi> in feeding, <hi>Soli cibi devorationi blanditur,</hi> Doth only flatter his appetite with devouring of meate, and esteemeth more of one cooke then of diverse husbandmen. <hi>A foole</hi> in his feeding is ever immoderate, <hi>Intruso in ventrem nutrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, tanquam ad viaticum non ad digestionem edulia reponat,</hi> Thrusting his meate into his stomacke, as if hee laid up provision for a journey,

And must not his hunger againe be satisfied, or else hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live as well as a fooles hunger?

He that will but walke in the labour of any course of life, may easily bee able to walke before the living. But what hath the poore more in preserving of his life by food, or what hath he lesse then any other? Hee may bee stronger in digesting of his meate, and the strength also of his body may be the greater by it, hee may be the healthier in his life, and his life also may continue the longer by it.<note place="margin">Clem.

He may have lesse to eate, and it may be, lesse variety to eate of, he may have <hi>nullas appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices coenae,</hi> No labels of dainties hanging to his lips, no banquets, or after services but in this vanity of humane nature, he is as weake as any, in this poverty of nature he is equall with any, and whatsoever his food bee, his hunger againe afterwards is the same that is in the rest of men. Now as it is in the bodily feeding of nature, so it is in the spirituall fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the soule by grace: when we have eaten, there must bee an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite againe, and againe must the appetite be satisfied, or else a spirituall life will not bee preserved in us.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 9. The Septuagint in reading of this verse doe give a good and plaine sense of it, and not dissenting from the force of Originall; they say, <hi>Melius est videre quod cupias, quam desiderare quod nescias,</hi> It is better to see that which thou desirest, then to desire that which thou knowest not. And although the saying bee true in respect of the object desired, <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> of a thing unknowne there is no desire, yet in respect of the effects which follow the thing desired, there are many who desire that, of which they know not, how it will prove unto them, nor what will be the consequences of it. Wherefore it is wisdome so to rule the desire as that the eye of the understanding doe alwayes goe before it, to discover the way that it caryeth us, and to foresee to what it will bring us; lest our desire be placed on something, which at last is most undesired by us. But to take the sense of the words, as they follow the preceding argument of the Preacher; I should conceive their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thus. That in dainty and voluptuous varieties of meate, <hi>the sight of the eyes is better then the wandring of the appetite,</hi> and it is better to bee pleased with looking upon them, then to please the appetite with fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on them.<note place="margin">Clem. Alex. Paedag. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> For though as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> speaketh, <hi>Insipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis sit ea quae epulis apponuntur valde admirari ac stupere,</hi> It be the part of a foole, much to admire, and with amazement to behold, those things which at feasts are set upon the table: notwithstanding as hee addeth, <hi>Insipientius est hominem servire ferculis, adeo ut eorum, ut ita dicam, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperantia una cum eis circumferatur à ministris,</hi> It is a more foolish thing for a man to be a servant to dishes, so that by intemperancy he bee as it were caryed by the servitors up and downe together with the dishes, and that <hi>his desire doe wander</hi> and walke after them, and as it were waite upon them, as they are set downe, or taken away, or else are removed from one place to another. For as the same Father speaketh, <hi>Vt in cibos reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; dominium obtineamus, non ut his serviamus ordinati sumus,</hi> Wee
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:177008:93"/> are ordained by God to have command and authority over our meate and drinke, not to be enthralled and subjected to them. If thou over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke them therefore comming where dainties are, it is a thing more seemely and better for thee, then to overcharge thy stomacke by feeding upon them, and by suffering thine appetite to wander and walk too bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely among them. For this is nothing else but as in <hi>Cl. Alex.</hi> it is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>in ventrem vesania,</hi> a belly madnesse, <hi>Symmachus</hi> as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us did read the verse thus,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Melius est providere quam ambulare ut libet,</hi> It is better to provide, then to walke as it listeth: and surely it is better to provide for cleering of a mans way and for keeping of his way, then by walking and wandring as hee listeth to meete with those troubles, which may crosse his passage, and whereby himselfe may be lost in his way. It is better to provide for the end of our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and for the accompt which then we are to make, that so we may bee receaved into the rest of joy; then by walking now as we will, to suffer then what we will not: and when we come to our walke and to seeke rest, to finde the way of endlesse torments to be opened unto us; surely this will shew our walking to have beene <hi>vanity,</hi> and to have brought us to nothing <hi>but vexation of Spirit.</hi> But to apply the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the verse according to the sense, wherein I have understood the foregoing verses. What is the renewed hunger and appetite of man, though never so often satisfied, but a vanity of nature? What is it, but as St. <hi>Hier.</hi> tels us, that <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Theodotio</hi> did render the words in this place, <hi>Pastio venti,</hi> a feeding on the wind? Seeing the satisfaction by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding passeth away, and the appetite is as empty as if it had but fed on the wind. <hi>Cl. Al.</hi> tels us, <hi>Amygdalae dicuntur inanes, non in quibus nihil inest,</hi>

In like manner the feeding of mans body is said to be a <hi>vanity,</hi> not because it doth nothing, for the appetite is satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the present by it; but because to take away the continuall renuing of the appetite it is altogether unprofitable and of no use. Againe, what is the excesse of feeding and pampering the flesh with voluptuous dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but <hi>a vanity</hi> of sin? What is it but a <hi>vexation of Spirit</hi> by those paines and torments which from diseases it breedeth? For as such feeding <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> dulleth and stupifieth the mind and understanding, so doth it quicken the sense to the greater misery and vexing of the spirit.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 11. Much and manifold is the vanitie of humane things, so that it need not to be made more. But <hi>seeing there be also many things that doe encrease it,</hi> why should any man labour to encrease it to himselfe? Why should man by contending with God, and by seeking to cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the blame of humane vanitie, thereby make himselfe to suffer the more in his discontented and troubled thoughts, and by provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the anger of God, make him to heape the more vanities upon him, and then <hi>what is man the better?</hi> But among the many things that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease vanitie, there is one especially, to whom all other things are but serving instruments, and that is the devill. He was the authour of mans vanitie and misery, and he laboureth still to be the increaser of it. When the devill tempting our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> sayd,<note place="margin">Cyprianus Serm. de Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junio &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. Christ.</note>
                     <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe:</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> asketh, why he did not rather say, If thou be the Sonne of God, ascend into heaven, because that agreeth rather unto the Sonnes of God. The answere which the Father giveth is, <hi>Nec tentando vult ascensum persuadere coelestem,</hi> He will
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:177008:95"/> not, no not in tempting perswade an heavenly ascending. All his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour is to cast men downe into earthly vanities.<note place="margin">Origen. l. <hi>1.</hi> in Job.</note>
                     <hi>Origen</hi> observeth that if the devill had smitten but one corner of the house, wherein the children of <hi>Iob</hi> were feasting, it had been enough to have throwne it downe; and thereupon asketh, what made him to smite the foure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the house? The answere which he giveth is, that he did it, <hi>Vt ostenderet ferociam, atque animum suum homicidialem,</hi> That he might shew his fiercenesse and his cruell minde to worke mans mischiefe and ruine. For leave and permission being granted from God, it seemeth sayth the Father, that all the devils made hast to assault the house on every side, striving as it were betweene themselves, who should be the first in causing the hurt. And surely, in smiting men with the winde of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, most eager and violent is the devils malice, and to encrease that, they are encreased in their number, where the goodnesse of God doth not restraine and curbe them. Wee reade in S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Marke,</hi> what the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils sayd to our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> when he cast them out of the man that was in the Synagogue,<note place="margin">Mark. <hi>1.23.</hi> &amp; <hi>24.</hi> Theophylac. in Euang. Marci.</note> Let us alone, what have wee to doe with thee thou <hi>Iesus</hi> of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? What is this sayth <hi>Theophylact,</hi> to destroy us? The answere which he giveth is, <hi>Hoc est, auferre à nobis potestatem, quam in homines habemus, ad torquendum sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licet eos,</hi> This is, to take away from us the power, which wee have over men for the tormenting of them. So that such is the greatnesse of the devils desire to torment men, as that they accompt it their destruction not to be suffered to doe it. Wherefore also on the contrary, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt it their gaine, their pleasure and delight, to vex and disquiet men with the vanities of this life. Shall any then joyne hands with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, to encrease their owne vanitie? Shall any contend with God, and thereby be at peace with the devill, that he may the more easily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their misery and trouble? What can man be <hi>the better for this?</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reads the first part of this verse thus, <hi>Quia sunt verba mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta multiplicantia vanitatem,</hi> Because they are many words multiplying vanitie: the words that are used in contending with God, and in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding against him, are but many words that doe multiply the vanitie and folly of sinne. <hi>Tremellius</hi> reads this verse thus; <hi>Quum adsunt res mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, multiplicat vanitatem; quid amplius isti homini est?</hi> When there is much wealth, that multiplyeth vanitie; what hath that man the more? And so also doth the French translation read it. Now the sense is good, and therefore let me consider it a little. One word whereby the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines doe expresse riches and wealth, is <hi>Facultates,</hi> Abilities, and the reason is given, <hi>Quia inde oritur hominibus facultas, multa licentiosè a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendi,</hi> Because from thence many have power and abilitie, of living li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiously: as, of voluptuous feeding, profuse drinking, wearing of gay and costly apparell, and other the like vanities, which thereby are multiplyed. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> therefore sayth, <hi>Aurum est materia laborum, periculum possidentium,<note place="margin">Augustin. de verb. Domin.</note> enervatio virtutum, dominus malus, servus prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> Gold is the matter of labours, the danger of the possessours, the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:177008:95"/> weakning of vertues, a naughtie master, a treacherous servant. And indeed, many are the cares and troubles, many the dangers and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, much the decay of goodnesse, cruell the commands, false the service, which proceed from wealth. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> tels us, that a Camel hath but one burden onely, but that a rich man hath two, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum terrenarum possessionum, alterum verò peccatorum,</hi> The one of his earthly possessions, the other of his sinfull vanities. The first he must lay downe at his death, whether he will or no; the last unlesse he doe lay downe before his death, he shall for ever cary and never be eased of it. But to shew, how much wealth multiplyeth vanities,<note place="margin">Greg. Mor. l. <hi>33.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that they who doe possesse it, <hi>Tanto familiarius diabolo serviunt, quanto hujus vitae successibus apud semetipsos altius intumescunt. His nam{que} cum gloria augetur elatio, cum elatione vero additur cura, huc illuc{que} animus tenditur, quia &amp; desideria cum rebus crescunt,</hi> By so much the more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and readily doe they serve the devill, by how much within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they are swolne higher by the successes of this life. For by these with their glory, their pride is encreased, with their pride also their care, this way and that way is their minde distracted, because their vaine desires also are augmented with their wealth. And what then <hi>hath such a one more?</hi> Surely more troubles, more miseries, more sinnes. And that he might have lesse of these, it were farre better for him, if he had lesse of the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 12. To contend, for I know not what, is a great shame, but to contend with God, for I know not what, what greater shame can there be? <hi>And who is there that knoweth what is good for man in this life?</hi> Who is there so well learned in the knowledge of himselfe? Who is so well studied in the knowledge of another? What art, what skill, what my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery is there, that can teach any one to know it? Many thinke, that this or that is good for themselves, or others. Many hope well, many are well perswaded of this thing or that thing, but who knoweth any thing?

                     <hi>caprea vulnerata dictamum petit, &amp; de vulnere excludit Sagittas; ursus aeger formicas devorat, ergo ferae norunt expetere ea quae sibi prosint, tu ignoras O homo remedia tua,</hi> The Lyon being sicke seeketh an ape to devoure it, that thereby he may be healed; the goate being wounded seeketh for dittany, and so driveth out the arrow from the wound; the beare being sicke devoureth pismires: the beasts therefore doe know how to seeke those things which are profitable for them, but thou O man knowest not the remedies that are good for thee. Man desireth often that as good for himselfe, which is indeed evill; and often shunneth that as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, which is indeed good for him. It is God onely that knoweth, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh, <hi>Quid nobis in hac vita expediat,</hi>

Man judgeth the troubles and miseries of this life to be evill for him, but God knoweth them to be good; and though in themselves they be evill, God turneth them

                     <hi>Et tanto mundior pòst ad judicem venit, quanto nunc ejus rubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem ignis tribulationis purgat,</hi> And afterwards he commeth by so much the purer to the Iudge, by how much now the more the fire of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth purge him, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh. <hi>Who knoweth what is good for man in this life?</hi> In this life, not onely many are the evils that doe besiege man, but man knoweth not what is good, and how then can he seeke it, much lesse finde it? But in the next life, there is nothing but good to be knowne; and though the good cannot be knowne as it is, yet as it is knowne, it shall be the compleate and endlesse good of man. There evill shall be knowne as a thing not to be feared, and whatsoever contentment may arise from the knowledge that others doe suffer it, they that are in that life shall never know it by any feeling of any in themselves. O therefore that men who cannot know what is good for them in this life, would seeke for that good in the next life! <hi>All the dayes of his vaine life, which he spendeth as a shadow:</hi> When <hi>Adam</hi> had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he went to the bushes and trees, to hide himselfe under their sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; and from that time it is, that man spendeth all the dayes of his vaine life as a shadow. Then his life became vaine, because he was departed from the fountaine of life; then all his dayes became a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,<note place="margin">Greg. Mor. l. <hi>11.</hi> c. <hi>26.</hi>
                     </note> and were turned into night: <hi>Quia amisso amore conditoris calorem cordis perdidit, &amp; in solo iniquitatis suae frigore permansit,</hi> Because the love of his Maker being lost, he lost the heate of his heart, and remained onely in the cold of his iniquitie, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh. But <hi>the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow</hi> here is most directly the shadow of ignorance, wherein man <hi>spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> all his dayes, seeth not, knoweth not what is good for him: but taking oftentimes shadows for substances, or beholding things as they are shadowed over by the subtiltie of Satan, by the vanitie of the world, by the blacknesse of his owne fond affections, is commonly mistaken in the truth of things. <hi>For who can tell a man, what shall be after him?</hi> What shall follow him, what shall overtake him: Who can tell him what is close behinde him, and may befall him the next day of his life? Wherefore though any one did know what were good for man, yet what were man the better? Seeing he could not tell him, whether he should enjoy it or no. The best way therefore for man, is to commit himselfe to him, who knoweth what is good for him, and what shall befall him: the best way is to submit himselfe to his pleasure, whose good pleasure can make all things to be good unto him: the best way is to get under the shadow of his wings, that there he may be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:177008:96"/> while he <hi>spendeth his dayes as a shadow. What shall be after him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne:</hi> That is, briefly, in this world. Man was made under the Sunne, made to see and know the truth of things, ordained to see and know his owne good; but sinne comming as a cloud betweene the Sunne and him, and though he be under the Sunne, yet keeping the light thereof from him; hence it is that he spendeth all his dayes as a shadow, and in the darknesse of ignorance: hence it is that being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the heate of Gods favour, <hi>Sub umbra interni frigoris abscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur,</hi> He is hid under the shadow of his inward coldnesse and vanitie. Wee say sometimes that the Sunne is under a cloud, but it is man, not the Sunne that is under the cloud: man who is under the Sunne, is under the cloud of his corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that makes him to lye under so many miseries, not knowing what to doe, what is good for him, what shall be after him.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Preacher having manifested the vanity of a false humane happinesse in the former part of this Treatise, proceedeth now to shew what the true happinesse of man is. And the happinesse of man consisting as <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> noteth,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc versum.</note>
                     <hi>Objective in Deo solo, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter in clara ejus visione &amp; frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, dispositive vero in meritorio opere,</hi> For the object of it in God alone,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:177008:97"/> for the forme of it, in a cleere vision and fruition of God, and for a disposition unto it in the works of a godly life. It is of the happinesse of man in this last kinde considered that the Preacher speaketh, <hi>Et quae est inchoatio quaedam perfectae beatitudinis, sicut dispositio est quaedam introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendae formae inchoatio,</hi> And which is a kinde of beginning of perfect happinesse, even as a disposition to a forme, is a kinde of beginning of the forme, which is to be introduced. Now the works of a godly life being the actions of vertue and devotion; the Preacher beginneth with the actions of vertue. And first, with the actions of prudence, which as the Philosopher sheweth,<note place="margin">Aristotel.</note>
                     <hi>Proprie sunt eligere ea quae sunt melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> Properly are to choose those things that are better. Wherefore in this verse he tels us, <hi>that a good name is better then precious oyntment,</hi> the one being but a perfume of the nostrils, the other a perfume of the heart. It is not sayd, a great name, arising from the greatnesse of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour, worldly wealth, worldly glory in any kinde: but <hi>a good name,</hi> arising from the goodnesse of a mans workes and actions.<note place="margin">Chald.</note> The Chaldee therefore doth thus reade this verse, <hi>Melius est nomen bonum quod comparabunt justi in hoc saeculo, quam unguentum unctionis, quod fuerit inunctum super capita regum &amp; sacerdotum,</hi> Better is the good name which the just shall obtaine in this world, then the oyntment of anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which was powred upon the heads of the Kings and Priests. And <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> rightly sayth,<note place="margin">Olympiodor. in hunc vers.</note> that the praise belonging to a name is due to that name, <hi>Non quod linguae sicut pictae tabellae efformant, sed quod ex officio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis actionibus viri justi comparant,</hi> Not which the tongues of men as painted tables set forth, but which righteous men procure by their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> considering those words of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>They call their lands after their owne names,</hi> thereupon sayth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.11. <hi>Chrysostom.</hi>

                     <hi>Ecce aliud genus amentiae, aedificiis, agris, balneis sua nomina inscribere. Ne nomen O homo aedificiis inscribas, sed trophaea recte factorum erigas, quae et in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senti vita nomen tibi conservant, &amp; infutura vita, immortalem tibi requiem comparent. Nihil enim facit nomen adeo immortale, ut natura virtutum,</hi> Behold another kinde of madnesse, to set their names upon houses, lands, baths. But O man, doe not ingrave thy name on houses, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect trophees of thy good workes, which will preserve thy name in this life, and in the next life will procure thee immortall rest. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that doth make a name so immortall, as the nature of vertues. When <hi>Iacob</hi> asked to know the name of the Angel that had wrestled with him; the reply of the Angel is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.29.</note>
                     <hi>Wherefore is it that thou dost aske after my name?</hi> And he blessed him there. What is this? His name was desired, and he gave him a blessing. It was not sure so much that the Angel would have his name concealed, as rather to shew, that the true glory of a name doth not consist in letters and syllables, but shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the actions of goodnesse and vertue. <hi>And the day of death is better then the day of ones birth.</hi> It is soone after the day of any ones birth, that anciently in the Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and still in the Church of Christians, his name was and is given to him. And it is the day of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:177008:98"/> death that maketh the name of any one to be good: for untill then what name hee will deserve, it cannot be said. Hence it is that the Preacher joyneth these together, and even thereby prooving that the day of death is better than the day of ones birth, because a good name is better than a name. It is true that <hi>in the day of death, peregrinamur à mundo,</hi> wee are absent from the world; but in <hi>the day of birth peregrinamur à Domino,</hi> we are absent from the Lord,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.</note> as the Apostle speaketh. It is true that <hi>the day of death</hi> depriveth us of the good things of this life, but it giveth us the better things of a better life, <hi>and is it not then better?</hi> It is true that <hi>the day of death</hi> taketh away the light of the Sunne from us, but it giveth us the light of God himselfe: it takes us away from the earth, but it brings us to heaven, and how much better is that? It is true that <hi>the day of birth</hi> enters man into many miseries, but <hi>the day of death</hi> sets an end to all. It is true that <hi>the day of birth</hi> brings forth a man unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sinnes, but at <hi>the day of death</hi> the time of sinning dyeth. It is true that <hi>the day of our birth,</hi> is the beginning of our journey to our Country, but <hi>the day of death</hi> leads us into it. And <hi>is it not better</hi> to be in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try then to bee travelling to it? <hi>Is it not better</hi> that sinne should dye in us, then we live to sinne? <hi>Is it not better</hi> to bee delivered from miseries then to be brought into them?<note place="margin">Ambr. de fide Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</note> Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> therefore tels us, <hi>Fuisse qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam feruntur populi, qui ortus hominum lugerent, obitus{que} celebrarent. Nec imprudenter: eos enim qui in hoc vitae salum venissent, moerendos putabant; eos vero qui ex istius mundi procellis &amp; fluctibus emersissent, non injusto gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio prosequendos arbitrabantur,</hi> There are reported to have beene some, who lamented the births of men, celebrated their deaths.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 2. The plague of sinne is that which alwayes raigneth; and therefore as in a time of the plague it is better to goe into a house not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:177008:98"/> infected, then into a house that is infected; so it is better to <hi>goe into the house of mourning</hi> which is not infected with the plague of sinne, <hi>then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the house of feasting,</hi> which is infected with it. The Originall word for feasting, is <gap reason="foreign">

What though <hi>in the house of mourning</hi> one being dead, all are sorrowfull, and <hi>in the house of feasting</hi> all bee merry and pleasant? yet <hi>it is better</hi> to bee with the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, that the cause of sorrow for thy sinnes may be the lesse; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merry for a fit to fall into some sinne, for which it will be needfull for thee to be long sorrowfull;<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.2.</note> Arise and goe downe into the Potters house, and there I will cause thee to heare my words. The Potters house is <hi>the house of mourning,</hi> wherein is the earthen vessell broken, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vessell of mans body broken by death. And if wee shall goe downe thither, that will make us willing to heare the words of God, whereby to keepe our soules from the infection of sinne. The very temper of sadnesse is a friend to vertue; whereas the heart set upon a merry pinne, is like one standing on the top of a Pinnacle, and in great danger of falling. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> therefore saith,<note place="margin">Chrysostome Hom. <hi>54.</hi> ad Popul.</note>
                     <hi>Sit aliquis gaudens &amp; laetus, effusus{que}, quid turpius? Sit aliquis dolens &amp; maestus, quid hoc est sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientius? Non enim stat anima firma sede, sed tanquam a quodam flumine tollitur, &amp; elevatur à voluptate, nihil habens stabile,</hi> If any one be very joyfull and profuse in mirth, what is more unseemely? If any one be sad and sorrowfull, what is more wise? For the soule doth not stand upon a firme seate, but is caryed away as it were with a river, and is lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up with pleasure having nothing setled in it. But <hi>in the house of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> there is a speciall cordiall and Antidote against the pestilence of sinne, <hi>For that is the end of all:</hi> by going into that house is shewed to what we must all goe; there the end of one sheweth, what is the end of all: for all must dye. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>Ex quo nascimur, necesse est ut moriamur: morbus hic necesse est ut ad mortem perducat,</hi> In that wee are borne, there is a necessity that wee must dye: this disease of necessily doth bring men to their death.

And how can it choose, but that this also should bee a meanes to restraine him from sinne? It was the first meanes which God used to keepe man from sinne to tell him of this

                     </note> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Qui considerat qualis erit in morte, semper fit timidus in operatione, &amp; paene mortuum se putat, quia mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riturum minime ignorat: perfecta enim vita est mortis imitatio, quam dum justi solicite peragunt, culparum laqueos evadunt,</hi> He that considereth what hee shall bee in death, is fearefull in the works of his life, and thinketh himselfe almost to be dead, because he is not ignorant that hee shall bee dead.

Wherefore we have here lastly the applying of the cordiall to the hear. <hi>And the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving will lay it to his heart:</hi> the living, he to whom God hath given life to see another dead that is living, and not dead in a careles course of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he will lay it to his heart. <hi>Symmachus</hi> did read it, as S. <hi>Hier.</hi> tels us, <hi>Respiciet ad mentem,</hi> will look unto his mind, and consider with himselfe, whether he be ready for his death or no. <hi>Tren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 3. A gravity of behaviour is better than a light wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and though it looke with the aspect of sorrow, yet hee that can but looke into the heart shall find that full of cheerefulnesse. Laughing and sporting are often by carelesnesse ensnared in the traps of trouble, whereas a sober sadnesse being more vigilant doth easily avoyd them, and give the heart more quietnesse. But the generall reading of the first part of this verse is, <hi>Ira melior risu,</hi> Anger is better than laughing. For though an affability of caryage,<note place="margin">Cassian. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut. lib. <hi>8.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> or else as in <hi>Cassian</hi> it is stiled, <hi>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciditas,</hi> a plausibility of disposition and behaviour be a thing acceptable to others, and that which giveth much contentment unto him that hath it; yet it is not seldome that a more sterne countenance, a more sower behaviour, though distasted by others, and causing discontentment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that hath it, is rather required and better chosen. Wicked <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> framing to himselfe one God,<note place="margin">Ter. contra Marcion. l. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> who was all mildnesse, all sweetnesse, and having no anger in him, <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth justly refute him saying,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:177008:99"/>
                     <hi>Hinc sufficit perversissimum Deum ostendi in ipso praeconio solitariae bonitatis,</hi> From hence it sufficeth to shew the perversenesse of his God, even from the praise it selfe of his solitary goodnesse. The meekenesse of the Dove is indeed commendable, but yet sometimes the sting of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent is more praiseworthy. Now this <hi>anger</hi> is chiefely to be preferred in two respects. First, when others would entise us to sinne: secondly, when by others we see sin practised. As for the first, how often hath an angry sadnesse of countenance, driven away the tempters and sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers unto wickednesse: whereas a courteous affability, a kind plausibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath made them the bolder to give an assault, and hath made the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault stronger in the successe of it.<note place="margin">Aristot.

                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> therefore speaking of affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility saith, <hi>Medium illud laudandum, quo quispiam ea quae oportet accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabit similiter &amp; agre feret,</hi> That meane is to be praised, whereby any one shall both accept kindly, and reject with discontentment those things which he ought. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reads it in the Proverbs,<note place="margin">Prov. <hi>6.6.</hi> Amb. Hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. cap. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Goe to the Bee, O sluggard,</hi> But why unto the Bee? Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> giveth an answer, who telleth us, <hi>Inter mella fundunt apes venena, si fuerint laces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitae,</hi> Among hony the Bees doe send forth poyson if that they bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked: and let him remember this, who is so full of hony in his affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, all whose caryage is nothing but a sweetnesse of disposition; and let him learne how to cast out the venime of his anger against the enticers and seducers unto wickednesse. Secondly, <hi>anger</hi> also is preferred, when wickednesse is committed by others, for how often hath a gentlenesse of caryage encouraged in wickednesse, when a rough temper might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily have stopped it? This was the fault of <hi>Heli, Sed quo contra subditorum vitia tepuit, eo contra ipsum districtio aeterni Rectoris exarsit,</hi> But he being only mildly warme against their sins that were under him, it made the wrath of the eternall Governour to burne against him,<note place="margin">Greg.

                     </note> as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh. But here as the same Father speaketh, a double anger is to be considered, <hi>Nam alia est ira quam impatientia excitat, alia quam Zelus justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae format. Illa ex vitio, haec ex virtute generatur,</hi> For there is one anger which impatiency stirreth up, another which the zeale of justice fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. That proceedeth from vice, this from vertue. But even in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a great care must be had, that immoderatenesse doe not transport it, and as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Gregor. Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>Excitata ipso zelo rectitudinis longe a recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine aberret,</hi> Being stirred by a zeale of rightnesse, it wander farre and erre from rightnesse. It is needfull therefore as <hi>Isidore Pelusiot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

The latter part of the verse by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters is read diversly. And if wee apply the anger against those who entise our selves to wickednesse, it may well bee read as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> hath, <hi>Emendabitur cor,</hi> The heart will bee amended; or else as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, that <hi>Symmachus</hi> did read it, <hi>Melior fiet animus,</hi> The
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:177008:100"/> mind will bee made better: which is the translation that <hi>Tremellius</hi> also doth give it; because anger against such corrupters doth preserve and encrease goodnesse in the heart and mind. Or else if we apply <hi>the anger,</hi> against those by whom wickednesse is committed, it may well be read as the Septuagint have it, <hi>corrigitur animus delinquentis,</hi> The minde of him that offendeth is corrected. Or else as I conceive it may not amisse bee rendred, <hi>Benignum fit cor,</hi> The heart is made loving and kind; it being a testimony of a loving minde and heart towards him that is reproved, when an angry countenance reprooveth his faults.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 4. The wise being in the house of mourning, the heart of them is there also: they are truly affected with it, they do indeed lament their deceased friend. <hi>Fooles</hi> being in the house of mirth, the heart of them is there also, they are wholly possessed, transported, ravished with it,<note place="margin">Olympiodor. in hunc vers.</note> and in their mirth are most serious. <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> therefore speaking of the former part of the verse saith, <hi>Vir sapiens funebri luctu secum ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo deputans se natum de corruptibili carne brevi ex hac vita migraturum; mortales caeteros qui eadem sunt nati conditione affectu pio prosequitur,</hi> A wise man by occasion of funerall sorrow considering in his mind that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe also being borne of corruptible flesh, is shortly to depart this life, sheweth a pious affection of sorrow towards others that are mortall and borne of the same condition. Whereas <hi>fooles</hi> being in the house of sorrow, they are little moved with sorrow, but their heart is in the house of mirth, sporting at least within themselves, when the outward occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion presenteth matter of sorrow unto them.

                     <note place="margin">Paulinus ad Pammach. Epist. <hi>35.</hi>

The same Father in the same Epistle speaking of sorrow for the dead, saith, <hi>Bonae lachrymae charitatis, in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Pater Abraham matrem repromissionis eluxit: bonae lachrymae pietatis quas Ioseph justus impendit patri.

But what doe I set forth the weeping of holy mortall men? <hi>Iesus</hi> also wept for his friend, and vouchsafing to take this passion also from our unhappinesse, he powred out teares for the dead.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:177008:100"/>
                     <hi>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning:</hi> his body, in which his heart is set, as it were in a house, being a house of mourning, as well in regard of the sober and sad demeanour of it, is in respect of the teares which he sheds, the sighs that he makes, both for his owne sinnes, and for the troubles of Gods Church, and the miseries of his people. <hi>But the heart of fooles is in a house of mirth;</hi> their body being full of the gesticulations of mirth, as well in respect of their light behaviour, as in regard of the vaine talking, ridiculous laughing, both of and at their owne sinnes, as also the distresse of Gods Church, the calamities of his people. <hi>Againe the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning:</hi> the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie mourning of the wise is in the house, private, and unknowne; it is not in the streets open to the view and notice of the world: for so the command of our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> is, <hi>When yee fast,</hi>

                     <hi>be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance, for they disfigure their faces, that they may appeare to men to fast. Verely, I say unto you, they have their reward. But when thou fastest, anoynt thine head, and wash thy face, that thou appeare not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father, which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. The heart of fooles is in the house of mirth:</hi> they have all their mirth to themselves, all is in the house, to the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, feasting, delighting of themselves, and their owne hearts. The heart of others is not made merry by them, either by the workes of charitie, or the good offices that they doe them. It is not abroad that their mirth is seene, within the dores of their owne house all is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> understanding this verse with reference unto that which followeth, giveth this sense of it,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Cor sapientis vadat ad domum talis viri, qui se corripiat delinquentem, ut adducat ad lachrymas, &amp; qui pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocet propria lugere peccata; &amp; non eat ad domum laetitiae, ubi doctor adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; decipit; ubi non conversionem audientium, sed applausus quaerit &amp; lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.

Such a teacher is to be lamented, being rich in speech, but not in the worke of the ministery.</p>

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 7. The French translation doth reade here instead of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Ce qu' on est trompe,</hi> This that they are deceived; maketh a wise man mad; and so the sense of the verse may seeme to be referred unto flattery, whereof the former verses speake, and by which when a wise man perceiveth himselfe to have beene deluded, it maketh him even <hi>mad</hi> with anger against himselfe. Our translation of oppression may be referred unto the rebuke whereof before the Preacher speaketh; which as comming from the wise, and being just, is worthy to be heard, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unjust, is enough to make even <hi>a wise man mad</hi> in vexing of himselfe. Or else wee may take the connexion thus, that the Preacher having shewed the infirmities of fooles, here he sheweth the infirmities of wise men: and first, shewing the weaknesse of a wise man oppressed; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he sheweth the corruption of a wise man oppressing: and of both he sheweth that their understanding is destroyed. <hi>Surely, oppression maketh a wise man mad:</hi> a wound is there most grievous, where the sense of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is most perfect, and therefore a wise man being most apprehensive of the wrong that is done him, and best able to looke into it, and to judge of every circumstance of it, that makes him to be the more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with it. But yet he that shall be so much moved with the wrong of another, as to loose his owne understanding, must needs be onely <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens in profectu positus,</hi> a wise man that is tending to wisedome, not one that hath attained to it, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Hierome</hi> well noteth,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.

Saint <hi>Basil</hi> speaking of himselfe sayth, <hi>Quo putas animum meum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore affecit fama calumniae illius, quam mihi offuderunt quidam; non metuentes judicem perditurum omnes loquentes mendacium? Tanto videlicet, ut prope totam noctem insomnem duxerim; ita ipsa cordis mei penetralia concepta moesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia occupavit. At necesse est ut omnia feramus, omnia patienter toleremus, ultionem ipsorum Domino committentes, qui non despiciet nos,</hi> With what griefe dost thou thinke did that calumny oppresse my minde, which some not fearing the Iudge, who shall destroy all them that speake lyes, did cast upon me? Even so much, that I slept not almost all the night, so had the apprehended sadnesse possessed the secrets of my heart. But it is necessary, that wee beare all, that wee suffer all patiently, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the revenge of them to the Lord, who will not despise us. This was a wise man indeed, feeling the force of oppression in making his heart sorrowfull, but yet overcomming it by the force of grace. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> doth well compare a wise man wronged unto the ship wherein
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:177008:103"/> our Saviour was asleepe: he heareth himselfe to be slandered, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is much moved with anger, <hi>Convitium ventus est, iracundia fluctus,</hi> The slander is the winde, the anger is the wave, and by them being tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he is in some danger. But when he studyeth revenge, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of that oppresseth his minde, <hi>I am navis propinquat naufragio,</hi> then is the ship neere to a shipwracke. And all is because <hi>Christ</hi> is asleepe in the ship; <hi>In corde enim hominis somnus Christi, oblivio fidei,</hi> For in the heart of man the sleepe of <hi>Christ</hi> is the forgetfulnesse of faith. Let the eye of faith be open,<note place="margin">Augustin. l. <hi>3.</hi> contra literas Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til.</note> and that will tell us, as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh, <hi>Non intuendum esse, quam sit amarum, sed quam falsum sit quod audio,</hi> That wee must not looke how bitter that is which wee heare, but how false it is. That will tell us, <hi>Quis quis volens detrahit famae meae, nolens addit merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di meae,</hi> Whosoever he be, that willingly detracteth from my credit, he unwillingly addeth to my reward.<note place="margin">Paulinus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. <hi>14.</hi> ad Celantiam.</note> Indeed, as <hi>Paulinus</hi> speaketh, <hi>Beatus qui tam sancte tamque graviter disposuit vitam suam, ut de eo sinistri aliquid ne fingi quidem possit; dum adversus obtrectatorum libidinem pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat meriti magnitudo,</hi> Happie is he who ordereth his life so holily, so wisely, that no wrong can be fayned of him; whiles that the greatnesse of his worth, withstandeth the malice of his slanderers. Or if wee be not so happy, let us be carefull, <hi>Ne ex nobis scintilla procedat, per quam ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versus nos sinistrae famae flamma confletur,</hi> That from our selves a sparkle doe not proceed, from whence the flame of a wrong report, may be kindled against us. Or if wee be not so carefull, <hi>Nos modo id agamus, ut male de nobis nemo loqui absque mendacio possit,</hi> Let us at least doe this, that no one may speake evill of us without a lye. And then if any will wrong us,<note place="margin">Chrysostom. Homil. <hi>26.</hi> in Acta A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postol.</note>
                     <hi>Rideamus, ploremus,</hi> Let us laugh, let us weepe, sayth Saint <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> Let us laugh, in comforting our selves in God; let us weepe, as lamenting our oppressours woefull estate. This is the part of a true wise man. To have wisedome to see the wrong that is done, and not to have wisdome to see how to beare it, will indeed soone <hi>make such a wise man mad. And a gift destroyeth the heart:</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, that the <hi>Septuagint, Aquila, Theodotio,</hi> did reade this verse, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe also reads it, <hi>Perdit cor <gap reason="foreign">

Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reading the first part of this verse,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> as the Septuagint doe, <hi>Better is the end of a speech then the beginning of it,</hi> giveth diverse interpretations unto it; as first, <hi>Meliores sunt in dicendo epilogi quam exordium, in his enim dicentis solicitudo finitur, in illo incipit,</hi> Better is the conclusion of a speech then the entrance of it, because in that the care of the speaker is ended, in this it beginneth. Againe, because when a speech is ended, the hearer considereth, of that which hath beene said; but when we begin to speake, he hath not as yet gotten any benefit by it. Againe <hi>quia melius sit tacere quam loqui,</hi> Because it is better to hold our peace, then to speake. Lastly he saith, that it may bee also understood
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:177008:104"/> thus, because while we are in this world; <hi>Quod scimus omne principium est,</hi> That which we know is all a beginning, but when that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is come, we shall in the end be made perfect. But to take it as our translation hath it; many reasons also may bee given of it. <hi>As first better is the end of a thing then the beginning:</hi> because the beginning is for the end, the end is not for the beginning: againe because the beginning of a thing is the imperfection of it, the end is the perfection: againe, because the end giveth knowledge of a thing, what it is, the beginning doth not: lastly because the end goeth beyond the beginning by many degrees. From whence is to bee learnt, not to judge of things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the beginning of them, but according to the end. For that may be much better then the beginning, at least wise it will direct much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our judgement of it. And let us also learne not to stop or stay our owne good courses in the beginning of them, but to proceed in them unto the end, because to end well is much better then to begin well. And that we may practise these things which we learne, let us <hi>be slow or long in spirit,</hi> taking time to weigh and consider all things before wee judge, and not <hi>proud in spirit,</hi> as we know all things and could judge presently. Let us be <hi>patient in spirit,</hi> and contented to beare the burden of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on, and not proud in spirit, as if in the beginning we were come to the top of perfection. But to consider the words, as they respect the foregoing passage. The Preacher having shewed the infirmity of wise men, when they are oppressed, here prescribeth a remedy against it, by wishing them rather to looke to the end, and to the right which in the end God will doe them; then to the beginning, and to the wrong which therein is done them. For there is an end to be made, when God will judge all in righteousnesse, and rewarding the patient, for the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they have suffered, will requite the oppressours according to their deserts. The vulgar Latin reading the first part of the verse thus, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior est finis orationis quam principium,</hi> Better is the end of a speech, then the beginning,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc versum.</note>
                     <hi>Lyra</hi> conceiveth it as if it were thus to be rendred, Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the end of prayer, then the beginning, and thereupon wishing the oppressed to goe to God for helpe, saith, that the end of prayer is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the beginning of it, <hi>Quia incipit a tristitia propter illatam sibi ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniam, &amp; terminatur in consolationem a Deo datam,</hi> Because it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from sorrow for the wrong receaved, but is ended in consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is by God granted. <hi>And the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit:</hi> the Originall is <hi>longus spiritu,</hi> long in spirit, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth such a one who though he be long wronged, yet is still patient. And this is more than to bee slow in spirit. For some at the time when they are wronged, are quiet and patient, and being slow in spirit, doe passe it by commendably: but afterwards calling it to mind, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much upon it, they inflame themselves with the fire of griefe, and studying for a meanes of revenge, <hi>Mansuetudinem quam tolerantes habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt,</hi>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:177008:105"/> is when they have cause to be angry, but they runne into it, before they have well considered of the cause, and before they have well ordered the passion of their anger.

For in receaving of strangers we use to say thus, that it is better to suffer a bad guest, then that by ignorance, a good guest should bee excluded, while that we take heed that a bad one be not admitted. But in the affections of the mind it is quite contrary: for it is incomparably safer not to open the inward dores of our hearts when anger knocketh, then to receave that which will not easily depart, and which from a twigge will grow to a beame, for it dareth even impudently to encrease faster then is thought. <hi>Be not hasty to be angry:</hi> the Originall word here
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:177008:105"/> used doth most properly signifie indignation: now indignation is, <hi>Qua is cui irascimur contemnitur &amp; vilependitur, quasi indignus à qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

Huic conjunctus est timor mentis quo irascens seipsum extollit, &amp; alteri praefert,</hi> That, by which he with whom we are angry is sleighted and contemned, as being one unworthy, from whom we should suffer such a thing. And with this is joyned a swelling of mind whereby he that is angry lifteth up himselfe, and preferreth himselfe before the other. And thus are the two verses well joyned together. For the former verse endeth with the proud in Spirit.<note place="margin">Arist. Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> But to take the word as it signifieth <hi>anger</hi> generally. Let no one imagine anger to be only a heate of passion, for that is only in the sensitive part of the soule, whereas anger is in the will especially, and the definition of it is, <hi>Motus animi male volentis alteri ob injuriam acceptam, &amp; doloris ultionem expetens,</hi> A motion of the mind ill willed towards another for a wrong receaved, and through griefe desiring revenge. In which respect the Philosopher calleth it, <hi>Libidinem ulciscendi,</hi> a lust of revenging. Wherefore when the Preacher saith; <hi>be not hasty to be angry,</hi> it is not so much, be not hasty to give way to the heate of passion, as be not hasty to give way to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of revenge. Neither doth he suppresse his anger, who suppresseth the violence of his passion, unlesse he also reject the seeking of revenge when anger resteth. The difference which S. <hi>Hier.</hi> maketh betweene fury and anger is this, <hi>Furor incipiens ira est, &amp; fervescens in animo indignatio;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym.</note>
                     <hi>ira autem quae furore restincto de siderat ultionem, &amp; eum quem nocuisse putat, vult laedere,</hi> Fury is anger beginning, and a boyling indignation in the mind; anger is that, which when the fury is extinguished, desireth revenge, and seeketh to hurt him, by whom it thinketh hurt to have beene done. The Preacher therefore saith, <hi>anger resteth in the bosome of fooles:</hi> that is the bed wherein the watchfulnesse of it sleepeth, and therefore <hi>Cassian</hi> saith, that they who are transported with anger,<note place="margin">Cassian.

                     <hi>Verse</hi> 10. The Preacher having shewed the impatiency of wise men and therein their infirmity for wrong receaved from particular persons: here hee sheweth and reformeth their impatiency against the generall times. For it is the manner and humour of too many, who would bee thought wise to condemne the times in an impatient discontentment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, especially if themselves doe not thrive or be not favoured in the times as they desire or as they thinke they should be. To expresse the impatiency of such men, the Preacher maketh them to aske a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, saying: <hi>What is the cause that the former dayes were better?</hi> For it is the manner of impatiency to bee asking questions, as if no right nor good answer could bee given to them. But the answer which the Preacher giveth to this question, is to forbid them to aske it, because it being a question that commeth not from wisedome, it should not come from them, that would be accompted wise. And surely it <hi>cannot bee a thing that is wisely enquired after.</hi> For though the question supposeth that the former dayes were better, yet how dost thou know it? Hadst thou lived in the former dayes thou wouldest have said the same of them. And still thou wouldest have commended that most, which thou diddest least know.<note place="margin">Matth. <hi>26.64.</hi> Matth. <hi>27.11.</hi> Hilarius in Matth. Can. <hi>32.</hi>

But I note it for this, to observe how well sighted the Iewes were in the times past, and in the prophesies of Christ, and how blind they were in the present times, when Christ the Messiah was present among them. Not unlike to them are many malecontent and impatient spirits, who see the goodnesse of former times, and extoll them, but cannot see the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God in the present times to praise him for it.<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding this verse saith, <hi>Nec vetus saeculum praesenti praeferas: quia unus utrius{que} conditor est Deus, virtutes bonos dies viventi faciunt, vitia malos,</hi> Neither doe thou preferre the old world before the present, because one God is the maker of them both; vertues doe make the times good to him that liveth in them, vices doe make them evill. And that it is not
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:177008:106"/> wisely sayd to speake so, he sheweth in another place, saying, <hi>Stul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est referre ad tempora, quum in nostra sit potestate,</hi>

Now shall any one thinke of correcting his works, or imagine himselfe able to doe it, whose worke hee is not able to praise? For as the same Father also speaketh, <hi>Talem sortitus est Dominum, qui talia facit, quae à nobis ne{que} laudari satis possunt,</hi> Thou hast such a Lord and master, who doth such things, as that by us they cannot be sufficiently extolled. It is true that wicked people doe pervert the works of God to their owne sinfull pleasures and desires, but therein they cease to be Gods Workes.

But when it offendeth it ceaseth to bee Gods, and when it ceaseth to bee Gods, it offendeth. But that which wicked men thus make crooked, God will one day make straight. And as for God himselfe, hee can make nothing crooked, and therefore none <hi>can make that straight, which he hath made crooked.</hi> Men by their impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency doe but make themselves more crooked, and make the straight rule of Gods justice the more to condemne them.

How in either of these dayes we are to behave our selves, the Preacher here sheweth. <hi>In the day of prosperity be joyfull:</hi> joyfull in thankfulnesse to God, and sing with the Spouse in the Canticles,<note place="margin">

This therefore let us doe <hi>in the day of prosperity,</hi> that it may not be said to us as it was to the Israelites by the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah, yee shall be ashamed of your revenues, because of the fierce anger of the Lord:</hi>

                     <hi>Iob</hi> was knowne to bee a righteous man in prosperity, but whether he would continue so in adversity was a thing not knowne. He was therefore touched, <hi>Vt qui notus erat Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potenti Deo, notus per flagella fieret &amp; nobis &amp; sibimetipsi,</hi> That hee who was knowne to Almighty God, by troubles might be knowne to us and to himselfe, as <hi>Gregory</hi> hath it.<note place="margin">Greg.

                     <hi>Consider</hi> and behold the great wisdome of God in thine adversity: <hi>Vt quum defecerit homo, &amp; subvenerit Deus, dum homo liberatur a Deo, Deus ab homine ut dignum est, honoretur,</hi> That when man faileth, and God helpeth; while man is delivered by God, God may be, as is most due, by man honoured. <hi>Consider</hi> and remember, that Christ hath left us an example, that we should follow his steps, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh.

                     <hi>est in rebus humanis, Deus nos per contraria erudit,</hi> My brethren, there is a kind of circle in humane things, and God doth instruct us by contraries, sometimes by <hi>prosperity,</hi> sometimes by <hi>adversity,</hi> now by one, and then by the other. These two God hath set as it were the two opposite scales of the ballance, whereby to keepe us upright in a due measure. <hi>Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> doth easily make mans heart too light, and then God by <hi>adversity</hi> addeth weight unto it.<note place="margin">Exod. <hi>8.8.</hi> Origen.

                     <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the prosperity of his kingdome did forget God easily, asking who is the Lord; but as <hi>Origene</hi> noteth, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te verbera Dominum nescit, verberatus supplicari pro se Dominum rogat,</hi> Before he was smitten, he knew not the Lord, being smitten he desireth that the Lord may be intreated for him. <hi>Adversity</hi> doth some times make mens hearts too heavy, and then God doth ease it by sending comfort, and taking away the weight of it: thus when God had strucken the hardned and rocky hearts of the <hi>Israelites</hi> with extremity of thirst, then hee commanded <hi>Moyses</hi> to strike the rocke, and made that to yeeld water unto them: thus when God had delivered them into captivity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet he did it as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">August. in Psal. <hi>84.</hi>

                     <hi>Non ad interitum, sed ad disciplinam, non damnante Patre, sed flagellante,</hi> not to their destruction, but to their instruction, not as a rejecting, but as a correcting Father, and when they were oppressed with the weight, he sent them still deliverers. <hi>To the end that man should finde nothing after him:</hi> but should be forced to acknowledge that God had set all things before his eyes, which might be the meanes of his happinesse.

The French here to make the sense more plaine read it thus; that man might find nothing <hi>a redire apres luy,</hi> to say after him, or to returne as a plea against him.

                     <hi>Et interfecit ipsum,</hi> and killed himselfe, adding upon it, <hi>Prima quidem specie Abelem occisum subindicat; sin autem diligentius rem expendas, ipsum Cain occisum à seipso.

                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:177008:112"/> when the flame punisheth, the wicked are slaine, the just are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. <hi>Nilus</hi> notes it in <hi>Daniel</hi> cast into the <hi>Lions</hi> denne, and shewing the injustice of men,<note place="margin">Nilus in As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetico.</note> the justice of the beasts sayth, <hi>Hominis virtus apud homines invidiae &amp; contentionis, apud feras venerationis &amp; honoris occasio fuit.</hi> The vertue of man with men was an occasion of envy and strife, with the beasts of honour and reverence. <hi>There is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickednesse:</hi> for though long life bee a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, yet as <hi>Eucherius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eucherius.</note> speaking of the blessings of this life saith, <hi>Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea id Deus largitur etiam malis, ne magnum bonum videatur bonis,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth God also sometimes grant it to the wicked, that it may not seeme to the good, to be a great good thing. But that which I rather note here, is this, that the Preacher saith, <hi>I have seene,</hi> as shewing it to be a thing which he saw with no great wonder or trouble of mind. For what though he saw the righteous to perish in his righteousnesse? he knew this world to the righteous to be like Aegypt to the Israelites, and as <hi>Eusebius Gallicanus</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Eusebius Gallican.</note>
                     <hi>Dum incolitur afflixit, dum relinquitur locupletavit,</hi> while it is inhabited it afflicteth them, when it is forsaken it enricheth them. He knew the very perishing of the righteous to bee better than the flourishing long life of the wicked. According as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sologus</hi> noteth upon that passage in the Gospell,<note place="margin">Chrysologus Serm. <hi>121.</hi>
                     </note> that the Angels caryed away poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi> hell swallowed the rich glutton, saying, <hi>Ecce fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, mors pauperis totam vitam divitis vicit, &amp; elatio sola pauperis totam divitis pompam transcendit &amp; gloriam,</hi> Behold brethren, the very death of the poore man excelleth the whole life of the wicked, and the carying away only of the poore man transcendeth all the pompe and glory of the rich man. What though <hi>he saw the life of the wicked prolonged in his wickednesse?</hi> Yet be knew that this length was but a little while, untill <hi>God</hi> would come to judge him for his wickednesse. According as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zephaniah</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Zepha. <hi>1.14.</hi> Ruper. Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>The great day of the Lord, it is neere, it is neere and hasteth greatly.</hi> Where <hi>Rupertus</hi> noteth, <hi>Nec semel contentus dixisse juxta est dies Domini, repetivit juxta est &amp; velox nimis, &amp; vere secundum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudinem periculi,</hi> Not contented that he had said, it is neere, he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, it is neere, and hasteth greatly, and so it is truly in respect of the greatnesse of the danger. Hee knew that though the wicked live and flourish,<note place="margin">Minut. Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix in Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio suo.</note> yet that as <hi>Minutius Faelix</hi> speaketh, <hi>Vt victimae ad supplicium saginantur, ut hostiae ad poenam coronantur,</hi> As sacrifices they are fatted for their punishment, as offerings they are crowned to their misery. The Poet saith,<note place="margin">Ovidius.</note>
                     <hi>Gramine pasta Phalisco, victima Tarpeios inficit jcata focos,</hi> The sacrifice fed with the grasse of the mountaine Phascon, being strucke coloureth the Tarpeian fire, so the wicked being strucke at length by death, colour with their bloud the fire of hell. Now the Preacher see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, he saw in it the vanity of this world. But though this bee the plaine and more evident sense of the verse; yet to the first part of it Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> though not in his commentary upon this verse, yet else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where giveth another sense, there is saith he, a just man that perisheth in his righteousnesse, <hi>Non quo justus sit, sed quo sibi justus videatur,</hi> Not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:177008:112"/> that he is just, but that he seemeth to himselfe to be just, and therefore wee ought not to trust in our owne righteousnesse. Now according to this sense of the former part, wee may also understand the latter; There is a wicked man, <hi>prolongans in iniquitate sua,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym, in c. <hi>26.</hi> Isai.</note> continuing in his iniquitie (for so the Originall is) not as if it were iniquitie, but as thinking it to be righteousnesse in his owne sight. Neither doth this sense unfitly agree with the following verses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 16. From the vertues of prudence and patience, the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher passeth unto justice; and first he removeth the excesse of it. <hi>Be not just overmuch:</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Ambros. de Poeniten.

                     <hi>Si virtutum finis ille est maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, qui plurimorum spectat profectum, moderatio prope omnium pulcherri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma est,</hi> If that end of vertues be the greatest, which respecteth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of most, then is a moderation of all things most commendable. For that it is which doth not offend even those whom it condemneth: that it is which the eares of men are willing to heare; that it is which their minds doe not abhorre; that it is which their hearts doe not feare. Certainly, he that desireth to redresse the vices or humane infirmitie, must as it were cary and beare the infirmitie it selfe upon his shoulders, and not cast it away in a rigid severitie. The good Shepheard in the Gospel is sayd to have caryed the wandring sheepe, not to have driven it; and it is not seldome that the cariage of a moderate reproofe, doth more good then the fierce driving of severe austeritie. For how should he commit himselfe unto thee to be cured, whom thou hast in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, and who knoweth that he shall be despised and not pittied by thee? There is no vertue that doth not consist in a mediocritie, and onely the love of God cannot be too much. For as <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Bernard. de diligēdo. Deo.</note>

                     <hi>Noli peccatis addere peccata, semel peccasse sufficiat, debemus erigere post rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam. Si enim juxta eos qui de Physicis disputant, novit hirundo pullos de suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co oculare Chelidoniae, cur nos ignoramus medicinam poenitentiae propositam es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se peccantibus?</hi> Doe not adde sinnes unto sinnes: let it suffice to have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned once: when wee are fallen, wee ought to arise againe; when a building is ruinated, it ought to be repayred: for if, as they who write of naturall things relate, the swallow know how to give sight to her young ones with the juice of Salendine, why are we ignorant, that the medicine of repentance is proposed unto sinners? Or else wee may take the exposition of <hi>Cajetane, Be not wicked overmuch;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Cajetan. in hunc vers.</note> be not carelesse to fall into any grosse sinne. He that sinneth least, sinneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch; but yet the goodnesse of God, doth not thinke overmuch of it, unlesse our negligence or wilfulnesse cary us into some haynous offence. The words of <hi>Cajetane</hi> are, <hi>Ne mortale committas peccatum,</hi> commit not a mortall sinne. Now though all sinnes bee mortall in themselves, yet there be degrees in the measure of them, and in the measure of Gods displeasure against them. Lesse sinnes may stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether both with the state of grace, and with the hope of glory; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinnes cannot, and therefore to fall into them is to be wicked over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, seeing the losse by them is so overgreat. Or else if we take these words with reference unto the former verse, and as carying an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition unto the sense thereof, then <hi>to be wicked overmuch,</hi> is to be too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle just, or to be unjust, which is indeed a great wickednesse, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much overmuch wicked. In the Proverbs <hi>Solomon</hi> tels us,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.10.</note> that diverse weights are alike abomination to the Lord, or else as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is, a weight and a weight, a weight too little, as well as a weight too great, is abhorred by him. It is the just ballance and weights that he appooveth: it is justice in all things that he requireth. <hi>Neither be thou foolish:</hi> the words also may be taken either with reference to the words next before, and then they shew onely the folly of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much wicked, which is indeed a greater folly by farre, then is in them who are the veriest fooles naturally. For they doe foolishly, because they see not how to doe better, but to see the greatnesse of a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse now the great danger of it, and to be admonished to keepe our selves from it, and yet to runne into it, this is a folly of all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Or else the word may be taken in a reference and opposition to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:177008:115"/> those words in the former verse, <hi>Neither make thy selfe overwise;</hi> and then, <hi>neither be thou foolish,</hi> is, neither make thy selfe to have too little wit, in not being able to discerne either what is thine owne right, and due to thy selfe, or what is the right of others, that it may be given to them by thee. <hi>Why shouldest thou dye before thy time? Cajetane</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cajetan.</note> speaking of these words sayth, that it is <hi>mira sententia,</hi> a wonderfull sentence: and indeed, many are the expositions that may be given to it. The Hebrew is, <hi>Why shouldest thou dye in a time not thine;</hi> that is, before thine old age, for that is mans time of dying, when the time of living accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the course of mans nature is expired. And this is that curse which God denounced upon the house of <hi>Eli,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.32.</note> That there should not be an old man in his house for ever. To this purpose let me have leave to relate a story out of Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> who reporteth that in a Citie of Catalonia neere to Valentia, in his time a young man of eighteene yeares of age being disobedient to his parents, and as overmuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and foolish falling into robberies, for which he came to be hanged: as he hung on the gallowes, on a sudden his beard grew out, and that together with the hayre of his head was changed to be white, and his face being turned to be full of wrincles, he appeared a man about nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares of age, the people that were present looking on and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this change.<note place="margin">Bernard. Tom. <hi>2.</hi> Quadrages. <hi>2.</hi> Dominic. quadrages. Serm. <hi>17.</hi>
                     </note> The meaning of it, the Bishop, as he sayth, received by divine inspiration, and taught the people, that the young man should have lived so long, if that he had lived in obedience to his parents. But to returne to the meaning of the words. <hi>The time for a man to die,</hi> is when he is ready for his death; even as when a Steward is ready for his accompt, then is the time for him to make his accompt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>be not wicked overmuch, neither be thou foolish,</hi> least God take thee away in thy wickednesse, in thy folly, and thou be not ready to make thine accompt. Or else <hi>the time of mans dying</hi> and going hence is, when heaven is ready and open to receive him; till then he may well wish to tary here; and therefore take heed of wickednesse, least God at once call thee hence, and shut thee out from thence. Againe, <hi>Est tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus morientis, &amp; tempus mortis,</hi> There is a time of him that dyeth, and a time of death, the time of death is, whensoever that commeth, the time of him that dyeth is, when that he hath time to consider of his death, to looke unto it, and to prepare himselfe for it: beware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore least for thine overmuch wickednesse and folly, God take thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way suddenly in a time not thine, and give thee not time to thinke of thine end. Yet againe, that is a mans time in which he provideth, <hi>Sibi non suis,</hi> for himselfe and not for the things which he possesseth: now many there are who spend all their time in caring for the things of this world, and have little or no regard unto themselves; wherefore if they dye in this time, what doe they but <hi>dye in a time not theirs?</hi> Lastly, when the wicked is in the height of his flourishing, and the greatnesse of his bravery, then is his time that hee desireth most of all to live, then hee would not dye by any meanes, and yet then doth God many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:177008:115"/> him of his prosperitie, and of his life also. In <hi>Iob,</hi>

The question of the Preacher in this place, <hi>Why shouldest thou dye before thy time?</hi> caryeth this force: As for God who hath the command of thy life and death, he doth not desire thy death, much lesse doth he desire it before thy time; wherefore then by thine owne wilfulnesse shouldest thou thy selfe shorten thine owne time, and dying before thy time hasten thy misery?</p>

And that commeth to passe two wayes, either when they come short of their rule, or else doe goe beyond it. Now the rule of justice and wisedome, and all the wayes of man, is the Law of God, and therefore unto this they must be conformed, so that they doe neither exceed it, nor yet come short of it. Wherefore sayth the Preacher, <hi>It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this;</hi> that is, reach forth thy hand so farre untill thou come unto it, but not to over-reach it. It is good to put forth thy care so farre, as to take hold of justice, as to take hold of wisedome, but not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much just, not to make thy selfe overwise. It is good also not to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thine hand, or to pull it in too much, but to let it out so farre, untill it come where it should be. It is good not to withdraw thy dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in such manner, as that thou be too little just, which is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch wicked; or else, as that thou have too little wit, which is to be foolish.

It must bee therefore the endeavour of men in their wayes to follow God, and neither to put forth their hand by any excesse, nor to pull it backe by any defect, but to make them equall to the rule of Gods law. The least erring from the rule, taketh away the goodnesse of the thing.

Wisdome giveth strength unto a foole, and a wise man by his good counsell is able to support a fooles weakenesse, as that hee shall resist his enemies.

Thou needeest not any other to shew thee thine ill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; there is one within, <hi>Qui secretam gannit in aurem,</hi> Who whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in thine eare what it is. Doe but turne thine hearing inward, doe but cast thine eyes upon thine owne breast; and from thence thou shalt be best informed of thy doings. There is no difficultie for thee there to know them. Indeed, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> also speaketh, <hi>Labor est potius aures obturare, ne audias. Ipsa se offert, ipsa se ingerit,</hi> The labour rather is to stop thine eares, that thou doe not heare thy conscience. Shee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth her selfe, shee thrusteth her selfe upon thee. Nay, shee will be heard, doe thou what thou canst, and make thee know thy sinnes. <hi>Nero</hi> after his much bloud-shed, may change his bed-chamber, but his fiends ever attend him, ever are with him, and are as parts of himselfe. If a wicked man could shift from himselfe, he might have some hope not to heare of his sinnes; but so long as he hath himselfe, he hath one that will tell him of his faults. Yea, what if a wicked mn in some sort doe runne from himselfe? His soule may flie from his body, but his conscience will not flie from his soule, nor his sinne from his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there he shall still have it brought unto his knowledge. <hi>That thou thy selfe likewise hast cursed others:</hi> the force of this reason may be conceived three wayes. First thus, seeing that thou thy selfe, as thou knowest, hast cursed others, and wouldest not that they should have heard it, or from others heard of it; be contented therefore in like manner, neither to heare nor to heare of the cursings and evill speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which others use of thee. So <hi>Lyra</hi> expoundeth it, saying,<note place="margin">Lyra, &amp; Glossa Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din. in hunc versum.</note>
                     <hi>Sicut nol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les maledicta tua investigari, sic nee debes aliorum investigare,</hi> As thou wouldest not that others should search out thine evill speakings, so the evill speakings of others ought not to be searched out by thee. Thus
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:177008:120"/> also doth the Ordinary Glosse understand it, applying to this place that common saying, <hi>Quod tibi non vis, alteri ne feceris: patere legem quam ipse tuleris,</hi> That which thou wouldest not have done unto thy selfe, doe not unto another: suffer the Law which thou thy selfe hast made. Of which Saint <hi>Austin</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Augustin.</note> that it is a sentence, whereupon all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under heaven are agreed, and which if wee referre to the love of God, extinguisheth all haynous crimes; if wee referre unto the love of man, banisheth all grievous wrongs. Secondly, wee may conceive the force of the reason thus; seeing thou knowest thy selfe to have spoken evill of others, and to have cursed them, for which thou mayest justly feare the wrath of God upon thee; therefore take not heed to the words of others that speake evill of thee, but passe them by, and forgive them mildly and quietly, that God may mercifully and graciously forgive thee also:<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> thus Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> seemeth to understand it, saying, <hi>Quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do novit conscientia tua, quod tu saepe aliis detraxisti, sic et aliis debes ignos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere detrahentibus,</hi> As thou knowest thy selfe often to have slandered others;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.34.</note> so thou must forgive others when they slander thee. He that in the Gospell was cast into prison by his fellow-servant, had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it to his Master, there was no end of that, but instantly the Masters anger was incensed, and he that was so courteous before, was then most severe. And surely, there is nothing that doth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the wrath of Almightie God, then when wee being ou rselves spared by him,<note place="margin">Ambros. in Psalm. <hi>118.</hi> Serm. <hi>20.</hi>
                     </note> will not spare others for the same things. Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> therefore sayth, <hi>Necesse est eam formam in te redire judicii quam in alium ipse decernendam putaveris,</hi> There is a necessitie that the same forme of judgement should returne upon thee, which thou thy selfe hast thought fit to be decreed against another. In the Lords prayer wee say, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses, as wee forgive them that trespasse against us:</hi> Where <hi>Chrysologus</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Chrys. Serm. <hi>71.</hi>

                     <hi>Homo penes te est potestas veniae, in te est indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiae jus, tu tibi remissionis autor constitutus. Gratis petis veniam qui tibi in alio indulgere contemnis. Homo tu tibi factus es ipse misericoridae mensura, quantum quaris misericordie, fac tantum,</hi> Man the power of pardon is in thine owne power, the right of indulgency is in thy selfe, thou art made the authour of remission to thy selfe. In vaine dost thou seeke pardon, who despisest in another to give it to thy selfe. Man thou thy selfe are made the measure of mercy to thy selfe; as much mercy as thou seekest for thy selfe,<note place="margin">Anselmus.</note> so much shew to others. <hi>Anselme</hi> therefore speaketh well unto us, <hi>Debetis conservis non negare, quod à bono Domino gaudetis vos per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepisse,</hi> Take heed, you must not deny unto your fellow-servants, that which you rejoyce to have received from a good Master. And a good Writer sayth also well, <hi>Cum hac obligatione Dei bona in te veniunt, ut à te in proximos proficiscantur,</hi> With this obligation doe the good things of God come unto thee, that from thee the like may proceed to others. Thirdly, as I understand, the force of the reason may be conceived thus: Seeing thine owne heart knoweth, that thou hast cursed others, and in thy speeches detracted from them, thou mayest be sure also that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:177008:120"/> others doe the same towards thee. For it is the justice of God, even in this world, to requite men in the same kinde that their wickednesse was committed. His law is, <hi>Thou shalt doe to them,</hi>

There is a threefold wisdome, <hi>Sapientia carnis quae ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica est Deo, sapientia mundi quae stultitia est apud Deum, sapientia vera quae est Dei,</hi> A wisdome of the flesh which is enmity to God, a wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world which is foolish with God, a true wisdome which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:177008:123"/> is the wisdome of God, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> sets them downe. The Preacher therefore having shewed how true wisdome was too far from him,<note place="margin">Bern. Serm. <hi>9.</hi> inter par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos.</note> too deepe for him, as well beyond his sight as his reach, hee sheweth how hee applyed and turned his minde unto the other two.

                     <hi>Circuivi ego &amp; cor meum, I and my heart tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about or made a circle to know, &amp;c.</hi> And surely it is well, when a man and his heart doe goe together. For too many goe to many places, whither their hearts goe not with them, to mind what they see, what they heare. Many goe to God, to the Church of God, but their hearts goe not with them, to consider and to apply to their heart, that which is said unto them. Many goe to the house of mourning, to the buryall of the dead, but their hearts doe not goe with them, to remember their owne mortality in that which they see. Many goe many wayes, but they take not their hearts with them to make use of those things which they meere with. But the Preacher tooke his heart with him, he and his heart turned about, he observed things, and his heart looking into them considered of them. I, in the Originall is expressed with an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasy, as if it contained as much as I the King, and I the Preacher, and who both had but one heart, which sought the good of his people. Or else we may take the Originall word, as it signifieth to make a circle; for in seeking of knowledge there is a circle made, and as it proceedeth from the effect to the cause, so it returneth from the cause to the effect. Or else in the Preacher we may conceive the circle to be, the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his heart, how all things proceeded from the power of God as the efficient cause, and how all things returned to the glory of God as to the finall cause. <hi>To know and to search and to seeke out wisdome:</hi> in the placing of which words wee may either observe the order of the Preachers intention, or else of his proceeding. If wee looke to the order of his intention, then knowledge is first, and the other two follow, as being but the way to come to his intention. If we looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the order of his proceeding, then knowledge is placed first, as being that which lead him to search farther, to seeke for more. And here we may consider the Preacher to speake in Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> words,<note place="margin">Bern. Serm. Beatus qui invenit sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam.</note>

The Preacher therefore that he might not be deceived, that he might know things truely, did search and seeke and cast up <hi>supputationem,</hi> the accompt and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of things. <hi>And to know the wickednesse of folly:</hi> As I conceive, wee may not amisse understand this of the sinfulnesse that is in that folly of man, which is accompted to bee the wisedome of man.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 28. <hi>Which yet my soule seeketh, &amp;c.</hi> The Preacher though he had found the way to find out the accompt of things, yet he had not found out the accompt. Or though he had sought diligently, counting one by one, yet he was still to seeke. There is a place in Wiltshire called Stonage, for diverse great stones lying and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there together: of which stones it is said, that though a man number them one by one never so carefully, yet that hee cannot finde the true number of them, but that every time he numbers them,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:177008:126"/> he findeth a different number, from that he found before. And this may well shew the erring of mans labour in seeking the accompt of wisedome and knowledge. For though his diligence be never so great in making the reckoning, he will be alwayes our, and not be able to finde it out. <hi>One man among a thousand have I found:</hi> the Preacher in seeking to finde wisedome, sheweth what helpe he found, it was but one of a thousand among the many thousands that were under him, among the thousands that attended upon him, it was but one of a thousand that he found faithfull in true wisedome to him. The rest either feared to displease him, or desired to humour him, or regarded not either what hee sought, or what hee found in it. Or else the <hi>man</hi> which the Preacher speaketh of is to bee taken generally for a good man, and hee it is who is, <hi>dignus viri nomine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hierom.</note> worthy the name of a man, he it is who being one of a thousand is worthy to be chiefe of the thousand. But though <hi>Solomon</hi> found but one, yet it may be that God found more: for when <hi>Eliah</hi> said, <hi>I, even I onely am left;</hi> God told him,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.</note>
                     <hi>I have left seven thousand in Israel which have not bowed the knees unto Baal.</hi> Howsoever this is certaine, that the number of the good in respect of the bad, is very little, even as one to a thousand. When the <hi>Syrians</hi> came up against Israel in the time of <hi>Ahab,</hi> it is said,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.27.</note> that <hi>the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids, but the Syrians filled the Country,</hi> and so indeed are the good, they are but like two little flockes of kids, but the wicked fill the world. The godly are but like the three hundred men of <hi>Gideon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7.</note> the wicked are as the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and are upon the earth like Grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers for multitude. <hi>But a woman among them all have I not found:</hi> among them hee had found none to helpe him in the finding of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>Omnes enim me ad luxuriam &amp; non ad virtutem deduxerunt,</hi> For all of them did draw me to wantonnesse and not to vertues, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> maketh him to expound his words. Or else more generally his meaning may bee taken thus, that having found out a very bad woman, he looked to finde a good woman also, but he could not finde any. Not that he did not simply finde any good, but that hee found not any so good as shee was bad. Or else he sayth, <hi>that he found none,</hi> because sayth <hi>Lyra,</hi> in respect of men, they were few:<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc versum.</note> or else in respect of themselves, they are sayd to be none, because they were so very few. For as the Philosopher speaketh,<note place="margin">Aristot. <hi>2.</hi> Physicorum.</note>
                     <hi>Illud quod modicum est, quasi nihil computatur,</hi> That which is little is esteemed as nothing.

The Scripture is full of the examples of good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> having reckoned up diverse of them, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to a Virgin,<note place="margin">Hieronym. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiam virg.</note> he concludeth, <hi>Haec breviter perstrinxi, ut nec te poeniteat sexus, nec viros nomen suum erigeret, in quorum condemnatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem foeminarum in Scripturis sanctis vita laudatur,</hi> These have I briefly passed over, that neither thou mightest repent of thy sex, neither might men be lifted up in regard of their sex, to whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation the life of women is praised in the sacred Scriptures. Let it cause modestie in women, that shee was the first sinner, and who having cast man downe in Paradise, did cast him out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.

But in a tropologicall application of this verse; as the Italian sayth, that words are women, and deeds are men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they must be maryed together:<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> So Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, <hi>Possumus &amp; cogitatus pro viris accipere, mulieres pro operibus, &amp; dicere quod difficile cogitatio alicujus pura inveniri possit: opera vero quia per cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus exercentur, aliquo semper errore commixta sunt,</hi> Wee may here take our thoughts for men, women for our workes, and say that hardly can the thought of any one be found pure: as for our workes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are performed by the body, they are alwayes mixed with some errour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 29. The Preacher having spoken much of the vanitie that is in men and women, and of the badnesse of them, least hereupon any blame might seeme to accrew to God, who was the maker of them, here he wholy cleareth God. <hi>Loe this onely have I found:</hi> The Originall word here translated <hi>onely,</hi> and so generally by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:177008:127"/> is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> and most directly signifieth <hi>Seorsim,</hi> apart. So that it, seemeth to mee, that the Preachers meaning may be, that he seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the consideration of man, the workes of God, and the works of man, he found the workes of God to be right all, and that it was man himselfe, who had made himselfe and his works to be perverse and crooked. And surely, who so ever will rightly judge of man and his wayes, he must consider them apart, as they proceed from God, and apart, as they proceed from himselfe, that so in all things God may be justified, and man himselfe may beare his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Or else to consider the words, as generally they are read. <hi>Loe this onely have I found:</hi> that is, this as a most manifest, most sure and undeniable truth. <hi>That God hath made man upright:</hi> Let a right line be extended never so farre, let it be extended infinitely, it will be right still; now God is rightnesse it selfe, and he being extended into his workes, they are right all. But of man who is the chiefest of his inferiour creatures, it is sayd, that <hi>God made him in his image, and after his likenesse.</hi> Now as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh, <hi>Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet id quod ad imaginem est, cum imagine convenire,</hi> It is necessary that he who hath an image, should agree with his image. And therefore it being sayd of God, <hi>Great is our Lord, and great is his power;</hi>

                     <hi>the Lord is upright, and there is no unrighteousnesse in him:</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> also addeth, <hi>Ab isto recto &amp; magno Deo, habet imago ejus ut ipsa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta &amp; magna sit; Eo magna est quo capax aeternorum, eo recta quo appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens supernorum,</hi> From that upright and great God, his image also hath it to be upright and great; great, in that it is capable of eternall things, right, in that it desireth heavenly things, and things that are above. <hi>Aquinas</hi> speaking of these words, that <hi>God made man upright,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1. <hi>Q.</hi> 95. <hi>Ar.</hi> 1.</note> sayth, <hi>Erat rectitudo secundum hoc quod ratio subdebatur Deo, rationi ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro inferiores vires, &amp; animae corpus. Prima autem subjectio erat causa &amp; secundae, et tertiae. Quamdiu enim ratio manebat Deo subjecta, inferiora ei subdebantur,</hi> The uprightnesse was in this respect, that reason was subjected unto God, the inferiour powers unto reason, and the body to the soule. The first subjection was the cause of the second and of the third. For so long as reason remained subjected unto God, the inferiour faculties were subject unto it. It is a question proposed by <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and it is generally handled by the Schoolmen, <hi>Vtrum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus homo fuerit creatus in gratia,</hi> Whether the first man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in grace, that is, whether in the act of creation there was given unto him onely a rightnesse of nature, or else a rightnesse of grace also. That a rightnesse of grace was given to <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, is a thing agreed upon, because by his fall he was deprived of it, but whether at the instant of the first creation it were given to man, that is their question. But if it were given to man afterwards before his fall, why not at first? And indeed what need of such questions? The reading of the latter part of this verse according to the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:177008:128"/> and the Vulgar Latin, <hi>Et ipse se infinitis miscuit quaestionibus,</hi> and he intangled himselfe with numberlesse questions, should teach them to avoyde such fruitlesse speculations. From this distinction of man, <hi>in puris naturalibus,</hi> in his pure naturall condition, and in the state of grace, some of the Schoolmen have looked too farre after <hi>Pelagius.</hi> Let it suffice, as the Preacher sayth, <hi>that God made man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> thinketh that this is sufficient to proove, that man even in the first instant of creation, was made in the state of grace. But the Originall word which the Preacher here useth in the end of the verse being the same which he hath used before in the five and twentieth, and seven and twentieth verses <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifying <hi>computationes &amp; ratiocinia,</hi> reckonings and accompts: let mee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider here God as a true and just accomptant, and making all things straight and right. When he made man he brought all things to a true accompt, he did cast up his body to a right temper, he did cast up his senses to a right obedience to reason, he did cast up his will to a right desire, he did cast up his minde to a right understanding; the generall summe of all, he rightly made to be the true happinesse of man. There was not the least errour in all his accompt. But they, that is, men <hi>have sought out many reckonings:</hi> which first must needs be wrong, because many, seeing the right in all things can be but one. And secondly, they are wrong because men have sought them out, who going out of the way in wrong paths, can there never finde the right way. They cast up many reckonings, and many are the things which every one according to his humour and phansie maketh rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of. In the body they reckon upon nothing but sensualitie, in the senses upon nothing but voluptuousnesse, in the will upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but pleasing it selfe, in the understanding upon nothing but vanitie and folly. The generall summes, to which they reduce all their reckonings are three, either pleasure, or profit, or honour. And whereas the Psalmist sayth,<note place="margin">Psal. <hi>20.7.</hi> Augustin. in Psal. <hi>19.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Some trust in horses, and some in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,</hi> that is, sayth Saint <hi>Austin, Hi volubili successione temporalium bonorum, &amp; hi superis praeferuntur honoribus, &amp; in his exultant,</hi> Some are drawne with the voluble successe of worldly benefits, others are set above their fellowes in height of honours, and in them doe prance and rejoyce. But howsoever, men may now make their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, they shall in the end see the falshood of them, when they shall finde the fruit of them, no way to answer to the cost and paines and time, which they have layd out upon them. But to consider the words also as wee doe reade them. <hi>But they have sought out many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions:</hi> mee seemes that men herein are like unto some busy heads and working minds, which being left in a good estate, and having well to live, by their inventions and devises are not quiet untill they have brought all to nothing, and cannot at last devise how to helpe themselves. For so man being by God made in a good estate, it was
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:177008:128"/> the devils invention, to set him on worke to finde out good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and ever since his minde being set upon inventions, the seeking of them bringeth him to misery. Wherefore Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> readeth the latter part of this verse thus, <hi>Ipse autem se implicuit doloribus mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> but he hath involved himselfe into many troubles. Or else wee may take <hi>the inventions of men</hi> to be fictions, like the invention of Poets: for indeed, whatsoever men conceive of them, they are no better than imaginary fictions, having no realitie of truth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in them.

And this the Preacher having shewed in the latter part of the former Chapter, by setting forth the difficulty of attaining wisdome, the rarity of a wise man, hee beginneth this Chapter with the excellency of him, saying, <hi>Who is as the wise man?</hi> Who, though never so rich in estate, who though never so great in power, who though never so high in honor? Nay who is rich in estate, who is great in power, who is high in honor but a wise man onely? <hi>Philo</hi> therefore speaking of wise men saith, <hi>Qui soli veri reges,</hi> who alone are the true Kings.

                     <hi>Ʋt discas quod sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem illum eodem quo mundum honore Deus dignatus est,</hi> That thou mayest learne, that God did grace that wise man with the same honour that hee did the world.

But to consider the manner of the Preachers words; they being set downe as a question do shew as it were, that he could onely admire
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:177008:130"/> him, and could not judge of him; and is as if hee said, as <hi>Philo</hi> speaketh, <hi>De sapientia, quae non me tantum sed toto mundo est antiquior, non est fas quenquam judicare nisi Deum aut aliquem sincerum purum germanumque amatorem ipsius sapientiae,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> And indeed seeing there are many, who doe promise wisdome, he is hardly found, who is able to discerne a true wise man from them who seeme to bee wise. And whereas there are many who are said to be able to resolve the hidden things of the Scriptures, hee is a rare man that findeth a true resolution. <hi>And who knoweth the interpretation of a thing?</hi> The French readeth it, <hi>Et qui scait que veulent dire les choses?</hi> And who knoweth what the things would say? For there is a speaking by things as well as by words, and it is by them as well as by his word that God speaketh to us, yea the things themselves, doe speak in their silent language; which he that is wise understandeth, and is able to give the interpretation of it. Wherefore when the Preacher saith; <hi>and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing?</hi> hee meaneth, who but a wise man, of whom the words before speake. The Septuagint and S. <hi>Hierome</hi> do read it, <hi>Quis novit solutionem verbi?</hi> Who knoweth the solution of a word, the answeare of a quaestion?

                     <hi>in the face</hi> the wisdome of man is not a little discerned, and well may it bee said to make <hi>the face to shine;</hi> seeing as <hi>Philo</hi> speaketh <hi>Habent sapientes,</hi>

                     </gap>, which properly signifyeth strength. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> reades it, <hi>Fortis faciem suam mutabit.</hi> The strong shall change his face. The vulgar Latin also <hi>Potentissimus faciem suam mutabit,</hi>

The French readeth it, <hi>Son regard farouche,</hi> His rough and wild aspect; the Septuagint as our English did take it <hi>for boldnesse,</hi> but then they read it as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, <hi>Et impudens vultu suo odietur,</hi> And an impudent man shall be hated by his countenance, as if the Preacher did shew the difference betweene the countenance of a wise man, and of an impudent man, declaring how pleasing the one was, how hatefull the other. And indeed as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a wise man is never impudent, so the countenance of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent man is hatefull to all that are wise. Or else to take boldnesse in a good sense, there is nothing that doth beter set the assure, and make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident the countenance of a man then wisdome doth. That giveth such boldnesse unto it, that oftentimes the very countenance of a wise man striketh terror into the wicked and foolish. But let mee have leave to give the words another meaning, and to referre <hi>the face</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned not to the face of a wise man, but to the face of the thing, whose interpretation a wise man findeth out.

Let my boldnesse bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, and I will shew my thoughts. It seemeth to mee, that <hi>I</hi> standeth here, as it were an answere to the quaestions of the former verse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Preacher speaketh as it were softly and with a still voice, as if hee would not bee heard, saying no more then <hi>I.</hi> And hee speakes also in a darke obscure manner, as if his modestie did cast a veile over it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth hee speake it, untill that first asking the quaestions, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of all men did in there harts prevent him, and say that it was hee. Our translation to make up the sense followeth <hi>Pagnine,</hi> and as hee saith, <hi>Ego moneo te,</hi> I admonish thee; so that saith, <hi>I counsell thee:</hi> I who have obtained wisdome and am able to counsell thee, <hi>I counsell thee,</hi> I who require obedience from myne owne subjects, do counsell all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to give obedience to their Kings, I who am unwilling to punish thee for not keeping the Kings commandement, do counsell thee to keepe it. <hi>To keepe the Kings commandement:</hi> The Hebrew is, to observe the mouth of the King, which is but one and the same. For as <hi>Philo</hi> speaketh; <hi>Regis officium est jubere quae oportet fieri, &amp; vetare a quibus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinere decet: caeterum jussio faciendorum, &amp; interdictio cavendorum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè ad legem pertinet. Atque ita consequitur, ut Rex animata lex sit, lex vero sit rex justissimus.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philo de vita Moysis.</note> The office of a King is to command those things which ought to bee done, and to forbid those things which ought to be avoyded. But the command of things to be done, and the forbidding of things not to bee done properly belongeth to the law. And so it foloweth, that a King is a living law, &amp; the law is a most just King. Now <hi>keepe the Kings commandement,</hi> as thou wouldest the commandement of thy Father. For as <hi>Philo</hi> also speaketh <hi>Parentis locum obtinet ac vicissim, tanquam à germanis filiis reverentiam postulat. Sunt autē principes (ut ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum fatear) publici parentes civitatum &amp; gentium, quotquot boni sunt, nec cedunt pietati naturalium.</hi> For hee holdeth the place of a Father, and in a mutuall respect requireth reverence as from naturall children. For
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:177008:131"/> Princes, (that I may confesse the truth) are the publike Fathers of Citties and people, as many as are good,<note place="margin">Philo de crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Principis.</note> neither do they yeild in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to naturall Fathers. <hi>And that in regard of the oath of God. Tremel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> reades it, <hi>sed pro ratione juramenti Dei,</hi> but with regard unto the oath of God, as if the meaning were that the King is so to bee obeyed, as that God is not to bee disobeyed, and that the oath made to the King were so to be kept, as that the oath made to God bee not broken. For there is nothing more sure, then that God is rather to bee obeyed then man. But to consider our reading, by the oath of God, may bee understood the word of God: for as <hi>Philo</hi> speaketh, <hi>Ipsa Dei verba sunt juramenta,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philo l. <hi>2.</hi> Legis Allegoriarum.</note>
                     <hi>legesque divinae &amp; jura sacratissima;</hi> The very words of God are oaths and divine lawes, and most sacred statutes. And then the meaning would bee no other then this; that we are to keepe the commandements of the King, because God doth command it, and that wee are to do it not only for feare of wrath but also for conscience sake.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roma.</hi> 13.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5</note> But <hi>the oath of God</hi> here more directly is the oath which is taken in the name of God, and whereof God is made to bee a witnesse. For so an oath properly taken is by <hi>Philo</hi> defined to bee that,<note place="margin">Philo de Planta. Noe.</note>
                     <hi>Quod est fidei signum firmissimum conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum cum Dei testimonio,</hi> which is the most firme signe of faithfulnesse joyned with the testimony of God. As for the beginning of an oath S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> seemeth to conceive that untill after the dayes of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> there was not any used. For saith hee, <hi>Qui fuerunt tempore Abrahae multa faedera fecerunt, victimasque mactarunt, &amp; obtulerunt sacrificia,</hi>

                     <hi>necdum erat juramentum,</hi> They who were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> tyme made many covenants, killed many sacrifices, sacrificed many offerings, and as yet there was not an oath. Indeed the first oath that wee read of was that betweene <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Abimelech</hi> at <hi>Beersheba,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Genes.</hi> 22.31.</note> from whence the place had its name. But as for the oath of subjects taken to their King, and which wee call the oath of alleagance, as far as I know, this is the first place that any mention is made of it. Among the heathens,<note place="margin">Plin. in Panegy. ad Trajan.</note> I find in <hi>Pliny</hi> that it was a thing done in <hi>Trajans</hi> time, who did sware unto his people, and had his people sworne unto him.<note place="margin">Cassiod. var. l. <hi>8.</hi> ver. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> And in <hi>Cassiodore</hi> I find that <hi>Athalicus King</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> did likewise take an oath unto his people and tooke an oath from them. But that which here is to be noted is the regard of an oath, and which is called the oath of God as due to him to bee performed, as well as unto him to whom it is made. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as our Saviour Christ saith <hi>Performe thyne oath unto the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.33.</note> It is storyed of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great that being resolved to destroy <hi>Lamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacum,</hi> as hee was going about it, <hi>Anaximenes</hi> the Philosopher and his Master came to meete him, and to intreat him for the Citty, which being forseen by <hi>Alexander</hi> hee swore that hee would not doe, that which <hi>Anaximenes</hi> should aske him.

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:177008:132"/> as Philo speaketh: <hi>Est jus-jurandum non exiguum negotium, tametsi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnitur propter consuetudinem,</hi>

                     </gap>. An oath is not a light buisinesse, although it bee despised because men are accustomed here unto: namely being the testimony of God concerning doubtfull things. Now to cite God as a witnesse of a lye, is a foule wickednesse; would any one come unto his friend and say, I pray you do a wickednesse for mee, for my sake doe something that is against right and reason? would not his friend abhorre him that should doe it? would hee not suddenly breake off all friendship with him? <hi>Et quod non audes ab amico petere, ad id Deum vocas?</hi> And that which thou darest not to aske of a friend, dost thou call God unto it saith Philo? Dost thou say to him give false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for me, be a partner with mee in my villany and treachery, <hi>Et quum sis Deus optimus servias scelesto homini,</hi> &amp; when thou art God the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goodnesse serve the turne of a wicked man. What can this be but horrible iniquity? The same authour therefore giving direction for an oath, saith, <hi>Juraturus debet omnes rei circumstantias diligenter perspicere, quanta sit, quam vera, quam benè à se percepta, tum seipsum considerare, num purus sit animâ, corpore, linguâ: nefas est enim per os quo profertur nomen illud sanctissimum, quicquam turpe progredi: quaeratur etiam tam loci quam temporis opportunitas.</hi> Hee that is to sweare ought diligently to looke into all the circumstances of the thing, how great it is, how true, how well perceaved by himselfe, then hee ought to consider him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, whether he be pure in mind, in body, in toung.

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. The water here is not so cleare, that it is easy for the sight to peice into it. <hi>Be not hasty to go out of his sight.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>Nesis festinus, à facie ejus abibis,</hi> Bee not hasty, thou shalt goe away from his face. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which reading let me propose what hath come into my mind. First then as I conceive the sense may bee taken thus. <hi>Bee not hasty,</hi> not hasty to come into the presence of the King, that may bee the way to have thy selfe put away quickly from it.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1</hi> Sam. <hi>18.1.</hi> Gregor. Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. Oratione in Origen.</note> Gregorius Thaumathurgus observeth, that it is not said that the soule of David was knit to the soule of Jonathan, but that the soule of Jonathan was knit to the soule of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. And surely it is better when the favour of a Prince doth call any one into his presence, then when the ambitious desire of any one doth hastely thrust himselfe into it. <hi>Stand not in an evill thing,</hi> if thou dost not goe away from the sight of the King, but standest before him, stand not in an evill way, that will at lengh be thy fall, when the sight of the King hath found it out. <hi>For hee doth whatsoever pleaseth him:</hi> the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall saith onely <hi>whatsoever pleaseth,</hi> and seeing I conceive it to bee spoken of a good King, I understand the sense, as if it were supplyed with <hi>whatsoever pleaseth God.</hi> And therefore when a good King findeth thy wayes to displease God, they will displease him also, and thou shalt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:177008:132"/> not stand in his sight. Or secondly, the meaning of the verse may bee conceived thus. Bee not hasty in the sight of the King, neither in thy words or actions, for so thou mayest hasten thy selfe to bee gone out of his sight. But if thou hast beene hasty and run into some errour, do not <hi>stand</hi> nor persist in it. For as S. Bernard speaketh, <hi>Alioquin non erit hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum peccatum, sed obstinatio diabolica.

                     </note> but a divelish obstinacy, and worthy are they to perish with him, who in a likenesse to him persist in any sin. <hi>For he doth whatsoever pleaseth him:</hi> It shall not bee as thou wilt, neither mayest thou doe, whatsoever thou pleasest, but it is he that is King, it is his pleasure that is done in all things. But to consider the reading of our translation. <hi>Be not hasty to goe out of his sight,</hi> if thou hast offended him, bee not hasty to bee gone from him, doe not presently forsake his service and attendance: such hast, may increase his displeasure against thee. But if thou dost stay, <hi>stand not in an evill thing,</hi> stand not to justify thy self if he will have it evill, thou must not think to make it good, <hi>For he doth whatsoever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him:</hi> whatsoever it bee which thou hast done, whether good or evil.

The Preacher having shewed that the pleasure of a King in his displeasure is not to be resisted, &amp; that the faults of a King by his subjects are not to bee corrected, here in this verse gathering his discourse, as his manner is to a head and conclusion, he giveth comfort for the one, and direction for the other. His comfort is in these words, <hi>who so keepeth the commandement shall feele no evill:</hi> his direction in the other words. <hi>Who so keepeth the commandement,</hi> that is, is carefull to do that which he ought, for that is <hi>the commandement</hi> which serveth for all men, of what rank or quality soever, that is <hi>the commandement</hi> which respecteth all estates and conditions, that is <hi>the commandement</hi> which is to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in all seasons and occasions, who so therefore keepeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and doth that which he ought, <hi>shall feele no evill thing.</hi> Perhaps he may not keepe the favour of the King, but if he keepe the favour of God, he hath lost nothing. The Hebrewes <hi>shall know no evil thing,</hi> and surely howsoever he may know what is the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of a Prince, yet knowing the good pleasure of God to bee towards him, he need not to bee too much grieved for it.

For the evill, as it is an exercise of his patience, so it is the encrease of his glory. The Originall according to the words soundeth thus, <hi>Non co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoscet verbum malum,</hi> shall not know an evill word, or as <hi>S.

                     </note> as if wee might take the meaning of the place to bee this, he that keepeth the commandement and feareth God, is so farre from rebelling against his Prince, so farr from taking upon him to correct him, that he knoweth not how to speake an evill word, either of him or against him. <hi>And a wise mans hart:</hi> the opinion of the Jewes was, whereunto accordeth the phrase of the sacred Scripture, that in the hart especially the soule did hold her residence and as it were her royall court, and that there, were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally exercised the noblest operations of the understanding, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, judgment, and other the like excellencies of mans most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious soule. But the more received opinion in the world hath been to place the working of these chiefest faculties in the head rather, and to leave unto the hart the passions only and affections, as griefe, joy, anger, love, wherwith mans soule aboundeth. In which diversity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to make a reconciliation the matter is not difficult: for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaketh not of those fruitlesse speculations which trouble and racke the braine with discourse or disputation only, and which as the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:177008:135"/> Philosopher speaketh may thrive in a wicked man as well as in a good, seeing the passions have no power upon them. But the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth the practicall actions of men, which testifie the goodnesse or badnesse of their lives, and which because God commandeth to bee lively, burning, harty, and likewise because in them the passions of the hart are of great force and strength, either by hindering or hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their vertue and efficacy (for experience daily teacheth, how much the moderation of our passions helpeth in good works, and how much the unrulinesse of them provoketh unto wickednesse, and stoppeth from goodnesse) hereupon the Scripture ascribeth to the hart also those practicall operations, seeing that by the passions of the hart they are either spoiled or bettered in man. <hi>Discerneth both time and judgment:</hi> It is not to bee conceived that Princes may not heare of their doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, or that they may not bee told of their faults, but it must bee done by one that hath <hi>a wise hart,</hi> and which is able <hi>to discerne his tyme</hi> when to doe it, and who knoweth how to do it with <hi>judgement.

Sometimes he no sooner seeth evill done then he is ready to reprove it, and to reprove it sharply where he knoweth that he may be bold, and that his speaking shall bee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. And what doth he then but spare not sparing? <hi>Quia dum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptionis verbum non distulit, citius hunc à culpâ liberavit,</hi> Because while he deferred not the word of reprofe, hee did the sooner free him from his fault. <hi>Liberè enim arguens non pepercit, sed in eo quod corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xit, pepercerat:</hi> For in that he repooved freely he did not spare, but in that he amended him, he did spare him. At other times a wise man heareth or seeth evill, and saith nothing, but seeketh and waiteth for a time, when he may best reprove it, as knowing <hi>Nisi sustineat, quando con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruè proferre correptionem possit, auget in eo malum quod insequitur.</hi> That unlesse he tary for a time when he may best bring forth his reproofe, he doth encrease the evill in that he seeketh to suppresse it, as <hi>S.

So likewise for the manner of reproving, a wise man discerneth, that sometimes it may bee done in a particular manner, but that sometimes it must bee done generally in a common speech of admonition, which he maketh for the good of all the hearers, and wherein he mentioneth those faults, which he knoweth him to have

A time there is, which judgment must discerne, and a judgement must fit and further time, both must go together, to accomplish every purpose. <hi>To every purpose,</hi> to the purpose of God, to the purpose of the Devill, to the purpose of the good Angels,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:177008:136"/> to the purpose of men. God himselfe observeth time, who cannot bee without an exact and prefect judgement, wherefore God is said to bee <hi>adjutor in temporibus,</hi>

Secondly to <hi>the purpose</hi> of the devill there is a time and judgement, and he hath his opportunities, his occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to draw men unto wickednesse.

Whereby he seemeth to signifie, that <hi>Obediah</hi> did so esteem of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things to come, which by the Prophets was enjoyed, that he thought it better not to live, then to live without it. Indeed wise men may, and doe, think and consider of things that are to come; <hi>David</hi> telleth <hi>Nabuchadnezzar, As for thee, O King, thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed,</hi>

Notwithstanding, though wise men may, and doe think and consider of things that are to come, it is not the wisest <hi>that knoweth that which shall be, and who can tell him when it shall be?</hi> But this verse may be referred either to a foole, or else to a wise man. First to a foole, who hath no purpose to looke unto the time and judgement that is for every purpose: but as the misery of man is great, that he knoweth not, what is to come, so he maketh his misery much the greater, by not endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know it in some kind as he can, by thinking, forecasting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering of it. Wherefore <hi>Tremellius</hi> expounding these words. <hi>And who can tell him when it shall be?</hi> saith <hi>Quis ex insipiente facere possit sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem?</hi> Who of a foole can make a wise man? It was the scandall that the

                     <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> But it was themselves in truth who were doing before their time; for as <hi>Chrysologus</hi> very well noteth, <hi>Sepelit vivos crudelitas immatura, &amp; de tempore, queritur, quasi antè tempus habere debuerit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chrysolog. Serm. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> Overhasty cruelty buryeth among the graves of the dead them that were alive, and yet complaineth of time, as if it ought to have them before the time. This untimely proceeding is also in all sinfull fooles. They are before time in making the vaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of this life to be the happinesse of man, and in placing their rest and contentment in them. They are after-times, as not thinking of the things that are to come afterwards, but as passing them over, as never to be, are so gone beyond in them, in their little regard of them. When <hi>Goliah</hi> said to <hi>David, Am I a dogge, that thou commest to me with staves?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.43.</note> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> shewing him to be worse then a dogge, saith, <hi>Si canis fuisses, nunquam dimicantem contrâ te Dominum provocasses sed ut canis interitum futurum, &amp; dignum supplicium metuisses. Pejores cane, qui nec virgam metuis, nec lapidem quo moriturus es,</hi> If thou hadst been a dogge, thou wouldest never have provoked the Lord fighting against thee, but as a dogge thou wouldst have feared thy destruction, that was at hand to come, and thy deserved punishment. Thou art worse then a dogge,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Homil. de David &amp; Gol.</note> who neither fearest the staffe, nor yet art afraid of the stone by which thou art to die. And surely sinfull fooles are worse then the very beasts, for they have some presage divers times of that which is to come. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly this may be applyed unto a wise man, who lamenting the misery of man in not knowing the things that <hi>are to come unto him,</hi> and finding no where any one <hi>that is able to tell him,</hi> is thereby stirred up to look the more carefully into it, and by the circumspection of his judgement so to consider things, and the fit time of things, that as much as may be he may prevent the uncertainty of them. For as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh, <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud ingenii, si quis potest vigore mentis praevidere quae futura sunt, &amp; tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ante oculos locare quid possit accidere; &amp; quid agere debeat si ita ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciderit definire, interdum duo, &amp; tria simul volvere animo, quae conjiciat,</hi>

                     <hi>aut singula conjuncta accidere posse, &amp; aut singulis aut conjunctis disponere actus quos intelligat profuturos,</hi> That is wisdome, if any one can by the strength of his mind foresee the things that are to come, and as it were set before his eyes that which may happen to come to passe, and can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine what he ought to doe, if that it happen so to come to passe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turning over two or three things in his mind together, of which conjecturing that either all may come to passe joyntly, or this or that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, or whether they fall out joyntly or severally, can by his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing so order his actions, as that they shall be profitable to him. Moreover a wise man considereth, that although divers things come to passe, and that he cannot know what is to come to him, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that all things are by God made and done for the good of men, and that they are not disposed without his Providence. For as <hi>Philo</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Semper autor curam gerit operis sui, communi necessariaque lege na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:177008:138"/> quemadmodum &amp; parentes curant suam progeniem,</hi>

Now because the Providence of God disposeth all things with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their fit times; therefore doth a wise man by labouring to judg rightly of all things, and by endeavouring to find out the fit times of them in some sort ease the misery of mans condition, by getting some kind of knowledge of what is to come, and by being able in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to tell when it shall bee.</p>

O what a workman is this Spirit! there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in teaching any thing which he will have learned. But it is <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of man, the Spirit of life in man, whereof the Preacher speaketh, shewing that he who hath power over many that are under him, hath not power over his owne spirit, over his owne life. That is a thing which though he doe possesse, yet he is not master of it. <hi>Homo vitae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modatus est non donatus,</hi> Man is but lent to his life, not given unto it, and the greatest King being but a man, must resigne his possession when the spirit leaveth him. It is the property of the law of nature, that it is common unto all; cold striketh all, heat troubleth all, griefe assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all, a power over the Spirit is denyed all. <hi>To retaine the Spirit,</hi> it was a fable among the auncients in former time, that God appointing unto every thing his office and function, he appointed unto death, to take away the lives of men, and that death refused that imployment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it should be by every one accused; but yet at length it did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, because God did promise that it should be by all excused. For so indeed it is: of one wee say that he dyed because he was an old man, of another, because he was intemperate in his diet, of a third, because he was carelesse of his health, and so seeking in all to excuse death, wee do as it were closely make shew that we are able to preserve from death, to retaine the Spirit. But as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh, <hi>Nihil prodest ora concludere, &amp; vitam retinere fugientem,</hi> It is to no purpose to shut our mouth to keep in our breath, and to stay life flying away from us. When the spirit is to be gone, no hands can hold it, no force can stay it, no perswasion can prevaile to make it to tarry, no command can retaine it.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:177008:138"/> He that can forbid things by laws in his kingdome, cannot forbid the Spirit to depart by any law hee can make. <hi>Neither hath he power in the day of death:</hi> it is storyed of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that having heard of Paradise, and that it was upon the earth, he was very eager in seeking of it out, and to that end comming into the East part of the earth, an old man meeting with some of his souldiers, bid them to tell <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he sought Paradise in vaine, for the way to Paradise was the way of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he did not take. But saith he, take this stone, and carry it to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and tell him, that from this stone, he shall perceive what himselfe is. Now the stone was a pretious stone, and of such a quality, that whatsoever thing was weighed with it, that was still the heavier, only if it were covered with dust, then it was as light as a straw. The meaning of the thing did easily appeare, as shewing <hi>Alexander</hi> and all Princes, that though in their lives they overweigh others, by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their power, yet that in death their power is nothing, and that then they weigh as light as any other. <hi>And there is no discharge in that warre.</hi> The Originall word here translated discharge, signifyeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a sending, and therefore in this place, which speaketh of warre, it may imply either a sending out of forces to withstand death, or else a sending forth of Ambassadours to make peace with death. But all is bootlesse in this warre. He that can send out never so great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to withstand his enemies, hath no forces that will resist this enemie. The word which this warriour beares upon his shield, is, <hi>Nemini parco,</hi> I spare none. Poverty spareth the rich, paine spareth the healthy, shame spareth the honourable, death spareth none, for no means that can be used against it. And therefore there is also no peace to be made with it. The Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaketh of some, who said,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 28.15. vers. 1.</note>
                     <hi>they had made a covenant with death:</hi> but in the beginning of the chapter, he sheweth who they are, namely the drunkards of Ephraim. For what is it but the voice of a drunken man, a foole, or a mad man; so to speake? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>Quum interitus inimicus vitae nostrae advenerit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>inducias accipere non possumus,</hi> When destruction, the enemy of our life commeth, there is then no truce to be had. <hi>Neither shall wickednesse deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver those that are given to it:</hi> wee read in the Psalmes; of violence and wickednesse that are in the citie, and that day and night they doe goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, upon the walles thereof. Where Saint <hi>Austin</hi> expoundeth it, <hi>Super muros ejus, id est super munimenta, super nobiles ejus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 55.9. v. 10.</note> upon the walls thereof, that is, upon the fortresses thereof, upon the nobles thereof: and it is not seldome seene, that such doe make wickednesse to be their wall, whereby to defend themselves. But what defence soever this may be in their life, it shall be none unto them at their death, it shall not then deliver them. <hi>Lyra</hi> expoundeth these words, of those wicked, <hi>Qui ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando mortē differre per artem magicam vel aliquâ superstitione credunt,</hi> who hope to put off death by Magick art, or else by some other supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious way. But that which is rendred wickednesse, according to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, may also be rendred <hi>inquietudo,</hi> unquietnesse. For generally
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:177008:139"/> none are more unquiet then fierce and swaggering Princes are. What are they but tumbling seas, whose boyling, swelling, overflowing waves bring terrour and trouble to all that are neere them? But God hath said unto them all, Hither shall ye come, and no further, and here shall your proud waves be staid,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 31.11.</note> here death doth arrest you. It is related of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, that as he went to his conquest, comming neere some wise men, he called them unto him, and upon asking them some questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, finding them to be wise men indeed, he bid them to aske some gifts of him, and they should have them. Whereupon the Philosophers said, Wee desire certaine immortality of thee: at which <hi>Alexander</hi> laughing, said, I accounted you to be wise men, but now I perceive you to be ignorant, I cannot give that to my selfe, and how then can I grant it unto you? Are you mortal, then say they unto him? I am said he. Then replied they, Why then dost thou disturbe the whole world, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the dominion of it, as if thou wert immortall. Lastly, wee may take the <hi>unquietnesse</hi> here spoken of, to be nothing else but the unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse of people to die, especially of great persons, and their much striving with death, and the great adoe they make against it, all which is not able to deliver them from it.</p>

As in the creation of the world wee often read, that God saw what he had done, and made; so in the consideration of things which are done by men in the world, the Preacher often saith, <hi>I saw.</hi> But that which God saw was alwayes good.

                     </note>
                     <hi>Plus est quod probetur aspectu, quam quod sermone laudetur: suodeni{que} utitur testimonio, non alieno suffragio,</hi> It is more that a thing is approved by sight, then that it is praised by speech; because it useth its owne testimony, not the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of another; so it setteth forth more the badnesse of worldly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, that the Preacher saith he <hi>saw</hi> them, as shewing that upon sight and consideration they manifested themselves to be vain and naught unto him. <hi>He had applyed his heart</hi> unto them, to look neerly on them, that he might the better see and judge of them as they were. It is also to set out the badnesse of them, that he saith, <hi>every work which is done under the sun:</hi> for <hi>Philo</hi> speaking of the Sunne, saith, <hi>Opino quod Sol &amp; Luna perpetuo lumen ministrat: semel jussi in rerum primordio, &amp; divinum mandatum indesinenter faciunt, non aliam ob causam,</hi>

                     <hi>quam quia malitia procul terminis caeli exulat,</hi> I thinke that the Sunne and Moone doe alwayes give their light. and being once commanded in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, uncessantly do keep the divine commandement, for no other reason, than because wickednesse is farre bannished from the bounds of heaven. And for the same reason the Preacher here being to speake of wickednesse, saith, that he saw it under the Sun. <hi>There is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his owne hurt:</hi> and when is this time? namely when being set in the place of a ruler, he is not carefull for to rule well. For as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Gregor. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. Hom. <hi>17.</hi>

But as I conceive, the meaning of the Preacher doth most directly ayme at the ruling of Kings. And surely there is a time when they doe rule to their owne hurt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when by the wickednesse of their gouerment they provoke the wrath of God against themselves. <hi>Josephus</hi> notes it in the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> of whom he saith, that for their iniquity and injustice, <hi>Alter super alterum irruentes multi parvo tempore perierunt,</hi>

But shall I not therefore meditate upon Gods word? Shall I not indeavour to find the meaning of it? When man meditateth, God inlightneth, and it is to mans endeavours, that God giveth his blessing. Much obscurity there is in this verse, and much variety in the translating of it. But first to consider to whom to apply it, by reason of these words, <hi>from the place of the holy ones,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> applyes it to Spirituall Magistrates, <hi>Qui quum viverent putabantur digni esse ecclesiae principes &amp; templo Dei,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Tremellius in hunc vers.</note> which is the function and seat of God: <hi>Lyra</hi> applyes it unto both, saying, <hi>Sicut sacerdotes &amp; principes mali qui tenent in terris locum Dei, isti in spiri tualibus,</hi>

Now for the translation of it, the Septuagint, and accordingly the Uulgar Latine, read it thus, <hi>Vidi impios sepultos, qui etiam quum adhuc viverent in loco sancto erant, laudabantur in civitate quasi homines justorum ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> I saw the wicked buryed, who when they were yet alive, were in the holy place, and were praised in the citie, as men of righteous works.

                     <hi>&amp; venerunt, &amp; de loco sancto egressi sunt, &amp; laudati sunt in civitate quia sic fecerunt.</hi> And then I saw the wicked buried, and they came and went forth from the holy place, and they were praised in the citie, because they had done so: which himselfe expoundeth thus, I have seen the wicked dead, and so buried, with such an opinion of them, as that they were esteemed holy on the earth. And these often after death are praised in the Church; and publickly are commended, either by their successours, or by the people as blessed in those things, which in probability they have not done. Or else wee may take the meaning which <hi>Lyra</hi> giveth, who saith, That when they were dead, then they were called wicked, but when they were living, were praised either in flattery, or else for fear. Both these translations doe seeme to have read in the Originall <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which signifieth to praise, whereas the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall word which now is read,<note place="margin">Tremel. in hunc vers.</note> is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> which signifieth <hi>oblivisci,</hi> to forget. Wherefore <hi>Tremellius</hi> reads it thus, <hi>For I observed those that had so ruled, being wicked, to be buryed after that they were departed, and they departed from the place of the holy, and to be forgotten in the citie in which they did so,</hi> As if the Preacher shewed, that though they were on high while they lived on the earth, yet that being dead, they were laid under the earth, and that as if the place of their authority had been but a place of memory, to keep them in mind for the time, when they were gone from them, their memory was gone also in the citie. The french Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation hath it thus, <hi>And then I saw the wicked buryed, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; and them who were gone and come from the place of the holy, who had well done to be forgotten in the City;</hi> as if the Preacher did compare together the wicked, and the righteous after death, as shewing how the one though dead, yet did return and live as it were again in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory that was retained of them, but that the other though they had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved holily, and done vertuously, yet that they were forgotten quite and dead, in the memoryes of men, as well as in respect of their own lives. Our translation hath it, as you have it set down before; As if the Preacher did set forth hypocrites in religion, who came to, and went from the Church of God with a great shew of holinesse: but that being dead they were forgotten, having left no workes of goodnesse behind them whereby to be remembred. But to take the Originall as it self speaketh directly thus, <hi>&amp; then I saw the wicked buried, &amp; they came &amp; they went from the holy place, and they were forgotten in the citie that they had done so;</hi> which is Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi> translation, only that he saith Praised, where the Hebrew saith now, forgotten. The sence which I gather from the foregoing, and following verses, is this, that as the Preacher had seen the lives of wicked rulers and governers, so he had seen and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their deaths, and that though they had judged others with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and opression, yet that themselves were then judged rightly, that

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:177008:143"/> it is this, such is the perversnesse and stubbonrnesse of this people, that thy patience, thy mercy, thy goodnesse is needfull to go among them, and a long with them. For though <hi>Moses</hi> himself were a most meeke man, as the Scripture testifieth, yet he acknowledgeth his owne pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence not to bee sufficient, but it is Gods patience which he confesseth to be most fit for them, which in the daily sufferance of grievous sinners is continually manifested. But to give the meaning of the whole verse, that which our translation as I conceive importeh, is this, that though the wicked who abound in sinnes, are not punished for them, but live at ease, and in prosperity, whereas they who feare the Lord and shunne iniquity are full of troubles and sorrows; notwithstanding that it is not the wicked but the Godly who have cause of comfort and joy. Indeed the foole that looketh on the wicked thinketh him to bee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,<note place="margin">

Wherfore the same Father sayth, <hi>Noli gaudere ad piscem, qui in esca sua exultat, nondum traxit hamum piscator,</hi> Do not rejoyce at the fish, which rejoyceth at his bayte, the fisher hath not yet pulled his hook: <hi>boni laborant quia flagellantur ut filii, mali exultant quia damnantur ut alieni,</hi> The good are troubled, because they are chastised as Sonnes, the wicked rejoice because they are condemned as aliens and strangers.

And himselfe giveth the meaning of it to be this; from hence that God giveth to him space of repentance who sinneth very much (for that doth an hundreth times signifie) and doth not forthwith punnish him in his wikednesse, but taryeth that he may be turned from his wickednesse; I understand how mercifull and gracious God will be towards them, who have a feare of him, and tremble at his word. The same Father in the same place tels us that <hi>Symmachus</hi> did read the former part of the verse thus. <hi>Peccans enim malus mortuus est, longa aetate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessa ei,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc versum.</note> An evill man sinning is dead, a long age being granted to him, which as he saith was expounded thus, That he who doth evil &amp; sinneth

Wherefore S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>vis nosse, nulla paena, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta sit paena?</hi> wilt thou know, how great a punnishment no punnishment is, consider a wicked man not punished, for it is the greatnesse of Gods anger against him, that he doth not punish him: <hi>magna est ira ejus,</hi>

                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.11.</note> they shall be very short. Wherefore when the Prophet <hi>David</hi> complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, <hi>I am withered like grasse,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> expoundeth it,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Non quod longam vitam quaesierit in presenti, sed quod de futuro timeat, ne longitudo vitae ipsius, ubi vera est vita brevietur,</hi> Not that he desired a long life in this present world, but because he feared of that which is to come, least there the length of his life should be short, where true life is. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> therefore speaking to one who is troubled at the prosperity of the wicked in this life, saith, <hi>Attendis ad dies tuos paucos, &amp; diebus tuis pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis vis impleri omnia. Quae omnia? ut damnentur omnes impii, &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronenter omnes justi. Istis diebus tuis vis haec omnia impleri? Implet ea Deus in tempore suo.

What all things? That all the wicked be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and all the godly be crowned. Wouldest thou that all these things should be fulfilled in thy dayes, they shall be fulfilled by God in his time. That which seemeth long to thee, is but a little while: all those things quickly passe away, and they who flourish for a time,<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psal. <hi>91.</hi>

For when their Sunne commeth to set, their temporal life to end, then the length of their eternall life shall quite be cut off; and not a day of comfort for ever shall be afforded to them. Or else these words, <hi>as a shadow,</hi> may be referred unto that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, and so <hi>Cajetane</hi> doth referre them,<note place="margin">Cajetanus in hunc vers.</note> who expounding these words saith, He compareth a man that doth not feare in the sight of God, unto a shadow, because as a shadow is not his true body, whose shadow it is, but only some representation of it, <hi>Ita non timens conspectum divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num non est homo sed hominis umbra,</hi> So he that feareth not the divine looke, is not a man, but the shadow of a man. He is not I say a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the use of understanding, but a shadow of a man: for the use of mans mind dependeth upon the feare of the divine sight, as it were upon the first rule. And indeed the Original seemeth to favour this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:177008:145"/> which saith, <hi>Qui non ipse timens a faciebus Dei,</hi> as if the sence were, who being not himselfe, feareth not before God, and that the negation did denie as well himselfe as his feare. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> therefore speaking also of the wicked, saith, <hi>Ideò peccasse se nesciunt, quia homines se non attendunt: nam si considerarent se homines, citius agno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerent,</hi>

This verse speaketh of two things which fall out in the world, the misery of the just; the prosperity of the wicked, and unto each the Preacher addeth a severall vanity, to make it the better noted. <hi>This is sayth he a vanity which is done upon the earth:</hi> for it is while the just are upon the earth, that this vanity cleaveth unto them, and that they have sinnes and corruptions in them, which by the evils of affliction are prevented and pared a way, that so they may not diminish their glory in heaven.<note place="margin">Chald. Poraph.</note> The <hi>Chalde</hi> Paraphase therefore writing upon these words expoundeth them thus, <hi>Vidi in Spiritu sancto quòd malum accidit justis in hoc saeculo ad removendam ex eis culpam levem ut, sit merces eorum integra in saeculo venturo,</hi> I have seen by the holy Spirit that evill hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to the just in this world, to remove from them lesse faults, that so their reward may be whole and perfect in the world to come. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> considering that answer of the Spouse, when her beloved cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her, <hi>I have put off my coate, how shall I put it on?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?</hi> thereupon saith, <hi>O grande misterium! ergone timet inquinare pedes remeando ad eum, qui discipulorum pedes lavit?

Shee feared indeed, because shee goeth upon the earth. For while the righteous go upon the earth, though with great earnestnesse and speed they even runne to God, yet such is the vanity of this life, that their feet are defiled, and affliction is needfull to wash the durt away. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>Nobis fratres semper putationis est tempus, sicut est sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per est opus: Scrutemur vias nostras &amp; studia nostra, &amp; eo se judicet quisque profecisse, non quum non invenerit quod reprehendat, sed quum quod invenerit, reprehenderit,</hi>

The other vanity in this world whereof the Preacher speaketh, is the prosperity of the wicked, and whereof the Preacher sayth, <hi>I sayd this also is vanity.</hi> A vanity it is the world, and maketh oftentimes even the righteous vaine in their imaginations, when they think upon it. So that as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, some one in his troubled mind is even ready to say, <hi>Deus, puto
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:177008:146"/> mali tibi placent, &amp; bonos odisti; amas eos qui faciunt iniquitatem,</hi> O God I thinke that the wicked please thee, and that thou hatest the good, thou lovest those that work iniquity. Another as the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speaketh, considering himselfe to be cast into prison, and there to be carefull to do the workes of righteousnesse, while he that did cast him into prison, though living in wickednesse, rejoyceth and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the pleasures of the earth, from hence his disquieted heart is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ready to say,<note place="margin">Augustin. psal. <hi>91.</hi>

                     <hi>Symmachus</hi> did read it thus, <hi>est difficile cognitu quod sit super ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> It is hard to be understood that which is done upon the earth.

                     </note>
                     <hi>the night is,</hi> when we are in heavinesse and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: what therefore is it that wee are briefely taught?

For he praiseth the righteousnes of God, <hi>Qui non accusat Deum, quia patitur aliquid mali, sed tribuit illud peccatis suis, &amp; emendationi ipsius,</hi> who doth not accuse God because he suffereth any evill, but ascribeth it unto his owne sinnes, and to God amending of him. As for the flourishing
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:177008:146"/> of the wicked, the same Father speaketh also very well, <hi>Nolite seduci prosperitate impiorum, nolite attendere florem faeni, nolite attendere ad tempus beatos, in aeternum miseros,</hi> Suffer not your selves to be seduced with the felicity of the wicked, regard not the flower of the grasse; regard not them who are happy for a time, and eternally misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. It is a common received opinion, that in this booke the Preacher often speaketh under the person of others. And that he doth so, Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> proveth, because in the end of the book he saith, <hi>Finem loquendi omnes pariter audiamus,</hi> let us all heare together the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or as wee read it, <hi>let us heare the conclusion of the whole matter.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregor. Dialog. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> For saith he <hi>si in libro eodem per locutionem suam personas multorum non susce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat, cur ad audiendum loquendi finem secum pariter omnes admonebat,</hi> If in the same booke, by the manner of his speach he had not taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the persons of many, why doth he admonish all together with himself to heare the end of the speach. Wherefore going on he saith, there are are somethings in that booke which are moved by way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry: other things which give a reason by way of satisfaction <hi>Alia quae ex tentati profert animo, &amp; adhuc hujus mundi delectationibus dediti: alia in quibus ea quae sunt rationis affert, atque animum à delectatione com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pescit,</hi> Other things which he produceth from the minde of one that is tempted, and as yet is given to the delights of the world: other things in which he discourseth according unto reason, and withdraweth the mind from delight. <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> speaketh doubtfully of this point and sayth, <hi>Anne autem dicat, quasi ea reverà fecisset, an fingens propter utilitatem nostram, ut consequenter ad scopum ducat orationem suam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregory Nyssen in Eccles. Homil. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>non possum asserere: liceat volenti quam velit ea de re facere conjecturam,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he speaketh, as having done these things indeed, or else as fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his speach in this manner for our profit, that he might the better bring it to his proposed scope, I cannot affirme: let it be lawfull for him that will, to conjecture of it as he will. The reason of this opinion is, because that there are diverse passages of this booke, <hi>Quae qui virtutem sibi proponit non libenter adsciverit,</hi> which he that proposeth vertue to himselfe would not willingly allow of as <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> speaketh. But that is as things are understood. In this verse, when some do read it, <hi>Forte convivia meditantur, calices praeparant, tempus rosarum expectant,</hi> They meditate of feasts, they prepare cups,<note place="margin">Augustin in Ps. <hi>99.</hi>
                     </note> they expect the time of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as Saint <hi>Austins</hi> words are upon the like occasion. And then the Preacher must be concieved to speake in the person of a carnall man, who mindeth onely the things of this life. But let it be free for me, to take the Preacher here as speaking from himselfe, and so to speak of a chearfulnesse of heart, which is a thing not only pleasing unto God, but gracefull in man. For the Preacher having spoken of the oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wicked, and of the troubles of the righteous, here he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a good remedy against them, and an excellent carriage in them. <hi>Then I commended mirth;</hi> when he had considered the troubles of mans
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:177008:147"/> life, then he commended cheerefulnesse, he commended it as a thing worthy of praise in it selfe, he commended it unto men, as a thing bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much good unto them. And this it is which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 100.2.</note> saying, <hi>Serve the Lord with gladnesse, come before his presence with singing.</hi> Although it be a service of misery and labour, in which thou art, yet passe through it with a merry and glad hart: doe not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at it, doe not fret, chafe, vex thy selfe for it. <hi>Non id agunt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mura tua ut non servias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Augustin. in Psal. <hi>99.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>sed ut malus sis servus,</hi> Thy murmurings doe not make thee not to serve still, but onely to be a bad servant in it, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh. But mark also, what the Prophet addeth, <hi>Come before his presence with cheerefulnesse;</hi> for it is no great matter to be cheerefull outwardly, but doe thou bee cheerefull in the presence of God, <hi>Non valdè lingua exultet, sed conscientia exultet,</hi> Let not thy toung be very merry, but let thy conscience be cheerefull: be glad and merry in the sight of the Lord, <hi>because a man hath no better thing under the Sunne.</hi> But above the Sunne there is farre better, there is such mirth as here can not be conceived, <hi>Ibi totum negotium nostrum erit non nisi laudare Deum &amp; frui Deo:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Augustin. in Psal. <hi>86.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>hoc uno beati erimus otioso negotio,</hi> There all our businesse wil be nothing, but to praise God, and to enjoy God: by this one quiet businesse we shall be blessed, as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh. While we are here there is nothing better then to be cheerefull, which maketh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to be much more comfortable, and maketh troubles to be much lesse trouble some. <hi>Then to eate and to drink and to be merry:</hi> although it be the bread of sorrow that thou eatest, although it be the cup of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thou drinkest, eate it, and drinke it merrily. Because oppression eats thee, doe not thou forbeare to eate thy meate; because afflictions swallowes thee up, doe not thou forbeare to swallow downe thy drinke, but doe both merrily, which will make thy meate and drinke to doe thee the more good. Or else we may take these words as an expression of inward cheerefulnesse, by the outward manner of the world. Thus saith S. <hi>Austin</hi> was holy <hi>Crispina</hi> cheerefull,<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psal. <hi>137.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Gaudebat quum tenebatur, quum ad judicem ducebatur, quum in carcerem mittebatur, quum ligata produceba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quum in catastâ levebatur, quum audiebatur, quum damnabatur. In his omnibus gaudebat, &amp; eam miseri miseram putabant, quae coram Angelis gaudebat,</hi> She was merry when she was apprehended, when she was led to the Judge, when she was sent into prison, when being bound she was brought forth, when she was lifted up in the cage, when she was heard, when she was condemned. In all these things she rejoyced, and they who were miserable thought her to be miserable, who rejoyced before the Angels.

And surely he it that is the Author of the goodnesse or badnesse of our dayes unto us. And therefore let us still be cheerefull, as thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his favour, as resting in his providence, as contented in his will, as obedient to his pleasure.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> speaking of a blessed man saith, <hi>his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night:</hi> where there is first a delight, there followeth such an earnest meditation, as that it ceaseth not day nor night. And so here where the <hi>hart to is applyed to know wisdome,</hi> there is such a seeking of it, <hi>as that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day nor night he seeth sleep with his eyes.</hi> But as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> noteth, that he meditateth day and night, <hi>In quo non tàm continua legendi po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulatur intentio, quàm servandae legis affectus. Ille enim plenè meditatur, qui sibi ipsi lex,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. in Ps. <hi>1</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>scriptum in corde suo opus legis intendens,</hi> In whom there is not required so much a continuall eagernesse of reading, as an earnest affection to the keeping of the law. For he meditateth fully, who is a law to himselfe intending the work of the law written in his hart. In like manner, the study of wisdome night and day is not so much to beate and break the braynes in the apprehension of it, as rather to make a right use of it, by the application of the hart unto it. <hi>Meditetur ergo legem vita nostra; meditetur conversatio, meditetur actus,</hi> Let our life therefore saith S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> meditate the law, let our conversation meditate it, let our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons meditate it; &amp; so let me say, let the governement of our wayes study wisdom, let the framing of our works study it, for that is to apply the hart to know wisdome. But what is the wisdome which the Preacher is so earnest to know? <hi>To see the businesse that is done upon the earth,</hi> that is to see the wisdom of Gods providence in ruling and ordering the affaires of the earth. And indeed as the glorious wisdome of God doth therein shine unto us, so it is needfull to observe it, and to looke into it. <hi>Seneca</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth it with wonder in the use of the winds, which suffer not the ayre to wax muddy, <hi>sed continuâ vexatione utilem reddunt vitalemque tractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> But by a continuall vexation tossing and taring of it, doe make it to be usefull and vitall unto them that draw it in; which, that the fruits may be gathered, blow away those superflous things which are mixed with them, <hi>Et latentem fructum, ruptis velamentis suis (quae folliculos a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricolae vocant) adaperit,</hi>

                     </note> &amp; openeth the hidden fruit by breaking the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings of it, which husband-men call the husck or hose of the corne,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:177008:148"/> which nourish plants and trees, and by shaking of them serve to ripen those things which they beare, drawing up the nourishment unto the top, which else might stay and be stopped: and which lastly give commerce to people devided far a sunder, and make man to know those things, whereof his owne countty would have left him ignorant. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> doth againe observe it, in the miseries of some, the ease and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of others. For saith he a fresh Souldier feareth the suspicion of a wound, but he that hath been long in the warres, boldly looketh on his blood, as knowing that often he hath won the victory, when he hath lost his blood; <hi>Hos ita{que} quos Deus amat, probat, indurat, recognoscit exercet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sene: l. de Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina Provident.</note>
                     <hi>eos autem quibus indulgere videtur molles ventuis malis servat,</hi> Those there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom he loveth, he proveth, he hardeneth, he knoweth, he trieth, but those whom he seemeth to spare, he keepeth them tender, for evils to come. It is needfull also to looke into the wisdome of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, thereby to be the better able to answer fooles who make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections against it. Some of them are proposed by Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> as <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis inquiunt providentia, Getulia sitit, &amp; mare compluitur? Et quare ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando percutiunt montem fulmina, &amp; non percutiuut latronem?</hi> What a providence say they is this, <hi>Getulia</hi> is dry and thirsty, and the sea is rayned upon? And why sometimes doe the lightenings shrike the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and not strike the robbers which are upon them? As for the sea, the Father answereth, that there are creatures living in it, which have need of of fresh waters, and which therefore doe often come into the fresh rivers for them. And whereas the objection going further saith, <hi>Quare pisci pluit &amp; mihi non pluit aliquando?</hi> Why doth it raine for the fish and not for me sometimes? The Father answereth; <hi>Ʋt cogites te in regione esse deserti, &amp; ut amarescat tibi vita praesens, futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramque desideres,</hi> That thou mayest consider thy selfe to be in a desert region, and that this life being bitter to thee, thou mayest desire that which is to come. As for <hi>Getulia</hi> he answereth, that in other places where corne can not be kept long, but is quickly corrupted,<note place="margin">Augustin. in Psal. <hi>148.</hi>
                     </note> there it raineth every yeare, and every yeare corne groweth: <hi>ibi quia raro, &amp; multum datur, &amp; diu servatur,</hi> There where it raineth more seldome, much corne is given at once, and it will also be kept a long time. Lastly as for the lightnings he saith, <hi>Majores majora noverint, &amp; det vobis Deus plus sapere quam dico,</hi> They who are more learned know more, and God grant that you may understand more then I say: but let me say what I consider, <hi>Ideo aliquando percutitur mons, qui non timet, ut mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetur homo, qui timet, &amp; tu quum das disciplinam, terram feris, ut infans expavescat,</hi> Therefore sometimes is the mountaine strucken, who can not feare, that man who feareth may be changed by it: thou thy selfe also, when thou reprovest thy child, dost sometimes strike the ground that the child may feare. To conclude this meditation, it is needfull to looke into the providence of God, that seeing his infinite majestie, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, love, power, wisdome, we may know him the better, and be stirred up to love him the more. For as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh in his
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:177008:149"/> meditations, <hi>Quisquis Domine cognoscit te, diligit te, obliviscitur se,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. <hi>148.</hi>

A faithfull searching perceiveth so much, as to adore God for that which man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive, and dareth not in any thing to blame that which is done by him. He that commeth into a workmans shop, and seeth many tooles there, <hi>Si non habeat peritiam artificis, &amp; habeat saltem considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem hominis, quid sibi dicit?</hi> If he have not the skill of the artificer, yet if he have at least the consideration of a man in him, what doth he say to himselfe? Surely these things doe not without cause lie here: the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knoweth why, though I know not. <hi>In officinâ non audet vitupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re fabrum, &amp; audet in mundo reprehendere Deum,</hi> In the shop he dareth not to reprehend a workman, and shall any one dare in the world to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God,<note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. <hi>148.</hi>
                     </note> saith Saint <hi>Austin.</hi> But if a man <hi>know not the worke that is done under the Sunne,</hi> much more doth he not know that, which is done above the Sunne. The counsels of God are much more hidden from him, if that which the Sunne shews him yet be concealed from him. <hi>Because though a man labour to seek it out:</hi> the labour of man by seeking findeth much, but this it cannot find; in this saith Saint <hi>Hierome, Nihil aliud proficit, nisi in suâ tantùm quaestione torqueri, &amp; disputationem pro tormento habere, nec tamen invenire quod quaerit,</hi> It profiteth nothing
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:177008:149"/> else but to be tortured in its owne rack, to be tormented with its owne disputation, <hi>and yet not to find that which it seeketh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chrysost. Dei Incomp. Dei Nat. Hom. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> The Uulgar Latine reads it; <hi>Et quanto plus laboraverit ad quaerendum, tanto minus inveniet,</hi> And by how much the more it shall be labour to seek, by so much the lesse it shall find it. For as <hi>Lyra</hi> noteth, <hi>ex tali curiosa inquisitione, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter aliquis in errorem incidit,</hi> From such a curious seeking often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a man falleth into errour. Yea, indeed the wayes of God are such, that not onely being sought they cannot be found, but that they cannot be sought also. Wherefore when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>that God dwelleth in light, which no man can approach unto,</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> noteth, <hi>Diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae Pauli attende, non dicit lucem incomprehensibilem, sed lucem inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilem, quod longe amplius est. Quod en: inquisitum &amp; investigatum comprehendi non potest, id dicimus incomprehensibile esse, quod autem neque investigandi ullo modo operam patitur, &amp; ad quod nemo proprius accedere potest, id inaccessibile est,</hi> Observe the diligence of <hi>Paul,</hi> he doth not say a light incomprehensible, but a light inaccessible, which is much more. For that which being sought and searched for, cannot he comprehended, we say is incomprehensible, but that which suffereth not by any means the labour of searching after, and which no one can come neere that is inaccessible. Yea, further, <hi>though a wise man think to know it, yet he shall not be able to find it out:</hi> a wise man thinketh with himselfe, that he can know much, and he resolveth with himselfe that he will know much, but let him think of himselfe what he can, let him resolve with himselfe what he will, his thoughts in his kind are vaine, his resolution fruitlesse, he cannot find out the wayes of Gods Providence. But as Saint <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> speaketh, <hi>Quantumlibet ad cor altum homo ascenderit, exaltatur Deus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cyprian de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din. Operib. Christi.</note> to how high a heart soever a man ascendeth, God is still exalted above him. Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and the Vulgar Latin read it here, <hi>Etiamsi dixerit sapiens se cognoscere:</hi> Although a wise man shall say that he knows it, yet it is but idle talke, for he cannot find it, that is, saith <hi>Lyra, Non poterit verbis explicare, ex quo patet eum se falso jactasse,</hi> He shall not be able to expresse it in words, from whence it is evident,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> that he did falsly brag and boast of himselfe. Yea, saith Saint <hi>Hierome, Quum haec dixerit se cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visse; tunc ignorationis principium habet, &amp; in profundo versatur errore,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> When he saith that he knoweth it, then hath he the beginning of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and then is he fallen into a deepe errour. Wherefore such a wise man, can be but such a one as among men seemeth to be a wise man. Notwithstanding the words here imply, that there is a reason of the things that are done, and that there is a right way in the doing of them, although they be in secret, and cannot be found out by man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let man be contented, and leave the works of God to God. For as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> considereth very well; If that I be ignorant of mine owne soule, and am not sufficient to understand what it is, <hi>Si ignota est mihi ratiò, quare ipsa delectetur corpore persecutore suo,</hi> if the reason be concealed, and unknowne unto me why my soule is delighted to be in the body which is the persecutour of it, <hi>Patienter me ferre oportet, si De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um

The first part beginneth thus, <hi>For all this I considered in mine heart:</hi> he that will rightly consider of any thing had need to consider of many things: all that doe concerne it, all that may give light unto it, had need to be looked into. <hi>All this</hi> therefore saith the Preacher I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in my mind, the Originall is, <hi>dedi in corde meo;</hi> I put in my hart,<note place="margin">Prosper de Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.

But yet I doe not think this to be the meaning of the Preacher in this place. For the Originall word here used it <gap reason="foreign">

In the meane while, there they

                     <note place="margin">Ambros.

But the more generall opinion is to referre this love and hatred unto God: in whom then, they are no way to be taken and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as they are in man, passions of corruptiō. For as <hi>Tertullian</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Corrumpi per haec homo potest,</hi>

If therefore wee understand them of God, wee must understand them in a divine manner. The <hi>Papists</hi> doe understand these words with reference unto God in this sort, as if any one in this life could not tell whether he be in the favour or els in the displeasure of God. But as <hi>Chemnicius</hi> well noteth,<note place="margin">Chemnici Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. <hi>1.</hi> Concil. Trident. de fide justifican.</note> if a righteous man cannot tell whether he be in the favour of God, cannot a wicked man tell whether God be displeased with him or no. For it is both whereof the words speak, and therefore that they have that meaning is more then I conceive. It may seem that <hi>S. Bernard</hi> did sometime understand them so, who speaking of this verse, saith, <hi>Terribilis est iste locus, &amp; totius expers quietis, totus inhorrui, si quando in eum raptus sum, illam apud me replicans cum tremore sententiam, nescit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo utrum amore an odio sit dignus,</hi> It is a terrible place and voyd of all quietenesse,<note place="margin">Bernad.

But in another place he gives it this exposition, &amp; speaking of these words he saith, <hi>Hic jam planè fidem nobis subvenire necesse est: hic oportet succurrere veritatem, ut quod de nobis latet in corde patris, nobis per ipsius Spiritum reveletur &amp; spiritus ejus testificans persuadeat Spiritui nostro quod filii Dei sumus.</hi> Here now it is needfull that faith doe come to helpe us:<note place="margin">Bernard.

                     <hi>Heu rara hora, &amp; parva mora.</hi> Alas it is a rare houre, and a spare stay. But yet the servants of God have that which is sufficient for them, and though not a certanity of security, yet a certanity of confidance, whereby they rely upon the promises of God. To grant then the words to be referred to God, the meaning of them is best shewed by him who hath delivered them. The next verse therefore he beginneth thus. <hi>All things come alike to all,</hi> and thereby declareth his meaning to be, that by the things of this life which come alike to all, no one knoweth either the love or hatred of God towards him. This our translation expresseth, by reading the conclusion of the verse thus, <hi>by all that is before him;</hi> And though the word <hi>By,</hi> be added to the originall, yet take we the Originall words as they are, the sense is the same: <hi>All is before them,</hi> that is, both are before them, as well prosperity which the world taketh for the love of God, as adversity which the world taketh for the hatred of God, all is before them, and they meete with both in this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>All things come alike to all:</hi> here saith <hi>Lyra, praedictae incertitudinis ponitur ratio,</hi> the reason is set down of the uncertainty, wherof the former verse speaketh. For the unrighteous sometimes prosper in this life, so do the righteous sometimes, as the unrighteous sometimes are afflicted in this life, so are the righteous sometimes, <hi>Et ideo non potest distingui accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Deo, ab eo qui non est acceptus per aliquid quod contingat homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> And therefore he that is accepted of God cannot be distinguished from him that is not accepted of him, by any thing which happeneth unto men. So that from hence he was even forced to give the right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the former verse; although in expounding of it he went the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of the Church of Rome: The following oppositions whereof the verse consisteth <hi>Lyra</hi> distinguisheth thus, <hi>To the righteous and to the wicked, quantum ad ea quae fiunt circa proximum,</hi> in respect of those things which are done towards our neighbour: <hi>to the good and evill</hi> as the vulgar Latin addeth, in respect of that, <hi>Quod respicit virtutem &amp; vitium,</hi> which respecteth vertue and vice: <hi>to the cleane and uncleane,</hi> in respect of that <hi>Quod respicit honestatem &amp; inhonestatem</hi> which respecteth honesty and dishonesty: <hi>to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not,</hi> in respect of that, <hi>Quod respicit erga Deum devotionem &amp; indevotionē,</hi> which respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth devotion &amp; indevotion towards God. And so <hi>Tremellius</hi> saith, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenti Deum, &amp; non colenti,</hi> to him that worshippeth God, and to him that doth not worship him, a part of Gods worship being used for the whole. <hi>S. Hierome</hi> saith that these are to be taken spiritually, as when it is said, <hi>The sacrifice of God is a broken &amp; contrite heart. As is the good, so is the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> that is saith <hi>Lyra, Quantum ad bonitatem &amp; malitiam operis generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> In respect of the goodnesse &amp; badnesse of the work generally. <hi>And he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath:</hi> in respect of the government of the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:177008:152"/> mouth and speach,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> which in using and shunning an oath is not a little shewed. But note by the way, how by swearing the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the mouth is signified,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.17.</note> therby to teach us how great a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse swearing is. And note againe that the opposite to this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse is not not to sweare but to feare an oath. For some may not sweare by education as having been used to the contrary or other the like occasion. But it is he that feareth an oath that shunneth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of it. And so it is in other things also. But that it may be the better understood how these persons being so different the one from the other, yet that all things should come a like unto them,<note place="margin">

                     </note>
                     <hi>Quod benignitatis earum merces, potuit in aeternâ vitâ retribui, sed culpa mendacii terrenam mercedem accepit,</hi> That the reward of there kindnesse might have been given them in eternall life, but the fault of their lying received a temporall recompence. To the first, concerning the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall promises made unto the <hi>Israelites,</hi> St. <hi>Austin.</hi> answereth, that in them were the figures of those future spirituall blessings, which in the Gospel are accomplished. For a carnall people did stick to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of this temporall life, <hi>&amp; illorum non tantum lingua,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Augustin. cont. Faustum l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>2</hi>

                     <hi>sed etiam vita prophetica fuit,</hi> And not only their toung, but their life was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall. To answere the second, and generally to shew a resolution of the doubt, the nature of a reward containeth in it the consideration of some good thing, and therefore according to the good of man, so is the reward of man. Now the good of man is twofold, either that which is simply and absolutely good, or that which is good in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. That which is simply the good of man, is only that which is the last end of all his desires, of which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.28.</note>
                     <hi>it is good for me to draw neere to God.</hi> This therefore and consequently all those things which serve and conduce to this end have simply the nature of a reward in them. That which is the good of man not simply but in some regard, is that which is good unto him now and then, and therefore is not also simply but now and then a reward: wherefore then if temporall things be considered as they are serviceable unto the works of vertue, by
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:177008:153"/> which we are brought unto eternall life, so they have in them the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a reward; as the increase of grace after the first grace bestowed upon us, and all other things by which we are helped on to attaine unto happinesse: wherefore as temporall things are so given unto men whether good or bad, so they are a reward simply: but as temporall things are considered in themselves, so as they are not the good of man simply, but only in some respect, so neither are they a reward simply, but only in some respect, <hi>In quantum scilicet homines moventur à Deo ad aliqua temporaliter agenda, in quibus suum propositum consequuntur Deo favente,</hi> namely so far as men are moved by God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Qu.</hi> 114. <hi>Ar.</hi> 10</note> to doe some things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, in which God favouring them, they obtaine that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and desired by them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.18. <hi>v.</hi> 19.</note> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> speaketh. Thus <hi>Aegypt</hi> is said to be the wages of the army of the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a reward to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> not in regard of their proud and insolent intention, but for as much as God was pleased to give successe unto the army, and to make <hi>Nebucadnezzar</hi> victorius over that Kingdome. The resolution then is, that as temporall things are a reward simply, which maketh them to have the nature of a reward in them, so they doe not come a like to all, but as temporall things are only a reward in some regard, so although they be a reward, yet that they may come a like to good and bad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. <hi>This is an evill among all things that are done under the Sunne:</hi> many are the evils which are done under the Sunne, many things which are seene and knowne to be evill, but this is an evill the like whereunto is not seene nor knowne among many, this is an evill the like unto which is not found among all. And therefore Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latin, <hi>Tremellius,</hi> doe all read it, <hi>hoc est pessimum,</hi> this is the worst evill. The adding of <hi>under the Sunne,</hi> sheweth that he speaketh of an evill of vanity to which this life is subject. <hi>That there is one event to all:</hi> and so it is often, so it is in very many things, but yet not so alwayes, not so in all things. For in his Proverbs the Preacher telling us, <hi>the eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evill and the good,</hi> thereupon <hi>Salvianus</hi> saith, <hi>Ecce habes praesentem, ecce intuentem, ecce in omni loco curâ ac providentiâ vigilantem. Idcirco enim &amp; bonos ab eo &amp; malos con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderari dixit, ut probaret scilicet nihil ab eo negligi, quem ostenderet uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versa rimari,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Salvian. de Gub. Dei l. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> Behold thou hast God present, behold thou hast him looking on, behold in every place watching with care and providence. For he affirmeth the good and the bad to be considered by him, namely that hee might prove nothing to be neglected by him, whom he sheweth to search into every thing. And as God beholdeth them who are not a like,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.15. <hi>v.</hi> 16</note> so he beholdeth them in a manner not a like. For as the Psalmist speaketh, the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his eares open to their cry: and let me ad as <hi>Salvianus</hi> doth, <hi>quam beati essemus omnes, si quam promptam erga nos Dei audientiam legimus, tàm promptè ipsi Deum audire vellemus,</hi> how happy should we be, if we would heare God so readily, as we read God to be ready in hearing of us. On the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:177008:153"/> other side the Psalmist in the same place tels us, <hi>the face of the Lord is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that doe evill, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Salvean. eod. liii.</note> So that as <hi>Salvianus</hi> addeth, <hi>Intelligis generalem quidem esse in omnes Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini visionem sed meritorum fieri disparilitate diversam, boni quippe aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuntur ut conserventur, mali ut disperdantur,</hi> Thou understandest the sight of God to be generall upon all, but to be made different by the diversity of their deserts: for the good are beheld that they may be preserved, the wicked that they may be destroyed. It is not therfore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>that there is one event to all;</hi> was there one event to <hi>Lot</hi> and the <hi>Sodomites; Lot cum affectibus piis ab urbe educitur, urbs cum habitatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus impiis concrematur; Lot</hi> with his good affections was brought out of the citty, the citty and the wicked inhabitants of it are burned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Was there one event to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> &amp; the <hi>Israelites? Pharaoh</hi> with his army pursueth them, <hi>castris jungitur, tenebris separatur, siccatur pelagus, Israel graditur, officiosâ undarum patientiâ liberatur, Pharaoh sequitur, mare super eum volvitur, fluctu operiente deletur,</hi> his campe is joyned to them, by darkenesse he is devided from them, the Sea is dryed, <hi>Israel</hi> goeth on, and by an officious patience of the waters is delivered; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> followes, the Sea returneth upon him, the overflowing waters cover him. Was there one event to churlish <hi>Nabal,</hi> and courteous <hi>David?</hi> Did not <hi>Nabal</hi> dye in the midst of his plenty? Did not God not only relieve <hi>Davids</hi> necessity but revenge his injury? <hi>Et quia se ipse ulscisci distulit, ultionem statim Deo executore percepit.</hi> And becamse he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to revenge himself, he had God forthwith to execute revenge for him. But yet it is true, as the Preacher here hath it, that commonly <hi>under the Sunne there is one event to all, Quae quidem quâ ratione patiatur Deus, neque humanae est imbecillitatis plenâ indagine cognoscere, neque nunc tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris disputare,</hi> which things for what reason God suffereth to be so,<note place="margin">Salvia. de Gub. Dei lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> neither is humane imbecillity able by a full search to know, neither is it now seasonable to discourse of as <hi>Salvianus</hi> speaketh. But from hence it commeth to passe that <hi>the heart of the Sons of men is full of evill:</hi> from hence it is that from the heart of men <hi>velut fonte prorumpunt malarum passionum flumina, lateque exundant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. de Noe &amp; Arca c. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> as it were from a fountaine rivers of evill passions doe break forth, and overflow every where. Hence it is <hi>that madn sse is in their heart,</hi> that is, a mad running after the pleasures of sinne, a restlesse giddinesse in the pursuing of them. For as <hi>Philo</hi> noteth, <hi>voluptas non est quiescentium &amp; stantium, sed commotorum &amp; perturbatione plenorum; at sicut flamma continuò movetur, ità flammae more hic affectus in animâ excitus non sinit eam quiescere,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philo Legis Alleg. lih. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> Pleasure is not a thing belonging unto them who are quiet and stand still, but to those who are tossed and tumbled and full of disquietnesse; and as a flame is continually moved, so like unto a flame this affection being stirred up in the soule doth never suffer it to rest, but rather like a madnesse caryes it uncessantly from one thing to another. Far is the mind of voluptuous sinners from any consideration or knowledge of what they doe: for as <hi>Philo</hi> also speaketh, <hi>Non sunt in rebus, duo tàm contraria quàm voluptas
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:177008:154"/> carnalis &amp; scientia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. lib. quod Deus Immutab.</note> There are not in things, two things so contrary, as carnall pleasure and knowledge are. <hi>While they live, and after that they goe to the dead:</hi> that is, they say within themselves, Let us eate and drink, for to morrow we shall die; while we live let us take our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, death commeth, and there is an end of all. For because they see the like event to come to all in this life, therefore they think that there is nothing to come after this life. But though under the Sunne things goe so, yet when the Sunne shall be darkned, and the Moone turned into blood, when the powers of heaven shall be shaken, there will be then a righting of those things, which in the vanity of this world are so much out of order. And indeed there is nothing that doth prove more forcibly, that the event of things will be otherwise at last, then that now, <hi>there is one event to all,</hi> both to good and bad. Wherefore, seest thou all things to fall out here alike, from hence be assured, that there is another world to come, in which the wicked shall have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their wickednesse, the good of their righteousnesse, and that things are here suffered to be alike unto them. For as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh, <hi>Si justus est, dignis quod dignum est reddit, si fortis, etiam post mortem reddit (hoc enim fortitudinis est) si patiens est, ne tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuemur, neque dicamus quare non hic invehitur?</hi> If God be just, he giveth unto every one that which is due unto him, if strong, he giveth it euen after death (for this is the part of strength) if patient, let us not tumultuously murmure, neither let us say, Why is not his justice shewed now?</p>

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:177008:154"/> sinful pleasures in this life, do here commend this life in regard of them. They say, <hi>to him that is joyned to all the living there is hope,</hi> or there is trust, that is, as <hi>Tremellius</hi> doth well expound it, <hi>Praesentia sunt bona quibus homo confidenter utatur, ac non futurorum expectatione seipsum lactet.</hi> They are the present good things, which a man may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently use, and let him not feed himselfe, let him not deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the expectation of things that are to come after death. And if I may note the words, in that it is said, <hi>joyned to all the living,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tremell. in hunc vers.</note> it may be conceived that the Preacher speaketh of a freedome of life, and a libertie to goe where he pleaseth, for he it is, who hath this, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth the pleasures of this life. But to consider the Originall Hebrew, there wee reade thus <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>associatur,</hi> Who is it that is joyned to the living? This reading it is that our English translation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, only that it doth not read it as a question. But if wee take that reading which we find in the Hebrew, who is it that should be chosen to all the living? I suppose that it may have this meaning, who is there that needeth to be chosen into the number of all the living, and doth not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choose it and desire it of himselfe? <hi>For a living dog is better then a dead lyon:</hi> that is, he that is alive, though in the worst condition, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he who hath beene of great account on the earth, but is now dead. For it is the manner of Scripture, by a dog to signifie a most vile thing, and by a Lyon to expresse excellency. But though this be the judgement of voluptuous sinners living on the earth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.13.</note> Saint <hi>John</hi> heard a voice from heaven, saying, <hi>Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, they rest from their labours, and their works doe follow them.</hi> Wherefore Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> comparing <hi>Vigilantius</hi> with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. vigilant. Epist. <hi>53.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Meliorque erit vigilantius canis vivens quam ille Leo mortuus?</hi> Shall <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> a living dog, be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that Lyon which is dead? Nay the poorest that is dead, and dead in the Lord, having lived in his feare, is better then the bravest Lyon that is alive on earth. The last part of the verse being a Proverbiall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; there are many expositions that are applyed unto it. One which Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> giveth is this, <hi>Peccator vivens potest esse melior justo mortuo, si voluerit in ejus transire virtutes.</hi> A wicked man living may be better, then a righteous man dead, if that he will change himselfe into his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Another which he giveth is this, by the Lyon to understand the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> of whom <hi>Balaam</hi> prophesieth, He couched,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numbers</hi> 24.9.</note> he lay downe as a Lyon, and as a great Lyon, who shall stir him up? By the dog he understandeth the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as our Saviour Ghrist speaking to the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> saith, <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 15.26.</note>
                     <hi>and to cast it unto dogges:</hi> the application he maketh thus; that the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> being forsaken, and so dead, the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are living, and enjoy the favours of God, are better then they. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> also tells us of another exposition, which his Hebrew master said that the <hi>Jews</hi> did give of it, which was by <hi>the dogge,</hi> to understand any ordinary tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher;
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:177008:155"/> by <hi>the Lyon,</hi>

                     <hi>Moses,</hi> or any other of the Prophets, and so the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to bee. <hi>Ʋtiliorem esse indoctum, &amp; eum qui adhuc vivat &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat, praeceptore perfecto, qui jam mortuus est,</hi> him to be more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, although unlearned, who liveth and teacheth, then a perfect teacher, who is dead and gone. The exposition which <hi>Lyra</hi> giveth of it is this, <hi>Per canem mordacem, &amp; leonem voracem intelliguntur homines mali, secundum tamen magis &amp; minus, sicut Leo est cane magis nocibus; &amp; sic</hi> Solomon <hi>hic loquitur metaphorice;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>sicut &amp; jam communi sermone, homo iracundus canis dicitur: est igitur quod peccator vivens est melioris condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis quam est mortuus.</hi> By a biting dogge, and a devourig Lyon, are understood wicked men; but yet with a difference of lesse and more wicked, as a Lyon is more hurtfull then a dogge. And so <hi>Solomon</hi> here speaketh metaphorically, as also in common speech wee say, that an angry man is a dogge: the sence thereof is, that a sinner yet alive, is in better condition then a sinner that is dead. And the reason is given by Saint <hi>Hierome, Quia viventes metu mortis possint bona opera perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hierony. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>mortui autem nihil valent ad id adjicere, quod secum semel tulerunt a vita,</hi> Because they who are living, may by the feare of death be brought to doe good works, but they who are dead can adde nothing unto that which they have once taken away with them out of this life. The <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> translation doth read this proverbiall sentence thus, <hi>Canis ille vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas prestantior est leone mortuo,</hi> that living dogge is better then a dead Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as if the sentence did point at some dogge more especially. And thereupon another exposition which I find applyed to the words, is this; by the dogge to understand such a one as barketh at strangers, and being undaunted, reproveth boldly the enemies of vertue &amp; religion: by the Lyon to understand him, who though great in power, place and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet being silent and dumb, in not reproving the wickednesse of such as are great in the world, in that respect is as it were dead, and so the living dogge, though of meaner condition, to be better then he; This is the praise which <hi>Nazianzene</hi> giveth to <hi>Hieron, Adesdum canis, non impudentia,</hi>

And surely this doth so commend a dog, who is thus alive, that in respect of him, a lyon is despicable, who is so dead as that he holdeth his peace when the shame of wickednesse cryeth aloud.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. The description of an <hi>Atheist</hi> is here set forth by foure marks. First by a carelesse knowledg of death, secondly by denying the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the soule, thirdly by denying the judgment to come, fourthly
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:177008:155"/> by denying God himselfe. <hi>The living know that they shall dye;</hi> here is their carelesse knowledge, they know it must be, and therefore care not though it shall be: it is a thing say they, that doth befall all, and therefore need not to trouble any, wherefore though they know it, yet it is as if they know it not, for they think not of it, they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of it; to reape a benefit from that which they know. <hi>St. Basil</hi> shewing the Devils policy, saith of him, <hi>furtim demit mortis timorem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Basil. Seleuc. Orati. <hi>3.</hi>

                     <hi>ut legis munimenta depraedetur,</hi> He secretly stealeth away the terrour of death, that so he may spoile the fortification of Gods law. For where that is lost, there is a headlong running on into all wickednesse. We observe commonly in the recovery of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the miracle that was wrought; but it is worthy the observing that as God added to his life, so he told him the time of his death. This <hi>Cyrillus Alexandrinus</hi> noteth saying <hi>Terminos vitae adjectae designat, ut finem intuens, &amp; se prorsus penitusque moriturum sentiens,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cyrillus Alex. l. <hi>3.</hi> in Isa.</note>
                     <hi>morbum superbiae non sineret in animum introduci,</hi> God setteth downe the tearme of his increased life, that looking upon his end, and knowing that certainely he was to dye, he might not suffer the sicknesse of pride to get into his mind. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the knowledge of death carefully and wisely apprehended is a strong bulwark against the temptations of sin. But it is a sleight know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of death which the wicked have, and because there is in their speech a kind of reproach which they cast upon humane nature, as it is the work of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21.</note> let mee tell them that their knowledge is not so certaine as they take it to be. For the living that do live righteously shall not dye, though themselves living wickedly do both dye and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. <hi>St. Chrysostome</hi> considering those words of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> that sin hath reigned unto death, thereupon tels us; that sin was as it were a King,<note place="margin">Chryst. Ihi. Homil. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> and death as it were a souldier fighting in the army under sin, and being armed by it: wherefore saith he, if sin arme death, then righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which commeth by grace and destroyeth sin <hi>(non solum mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem armis spoliat, sed &amp; illam de medio tollit)</hi> doth not onely spoile death of his armes, but taketh them quite away also. And therefore <hi>St. Basil</hi> speaking of the godly saith, <hi>Non jam mortui sunt, plantata namque cruce somnus mors est, ante crucem formidabilis, post crucem despicabilis.</hi> They are not now dead; for the crosse being as it were planted,<note place="margin">Basil. seulenc. Orat. <hi>23.</hi>
                     </note> death is a sleepe; that which was pretious fruite before the crosse formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; after the crosse, is made to bee despicable. The living therefore know, that they shall not dye, and they know it to Gods glory, and their owne comfort, being the children of God as well as the living know that they shall dye, and know it with carelesnesse in themselves, with reproach to God, not being his servants. <hi>But the dead know not any thing:</hi> here they denye the immortality of the soule; for as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> proveth the immortality of the soule from the knowledge of it, thus; every thing naturally desireth to be in his owne kind: now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in things that are indued with knowledge followeth their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: sense then knoweth the being of any thing, only as it is exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:177008:156"/> in this place, or at that time, but understanding apprehendeth the being of a thing absolutely and in respect of all time:<note place="margin">

In like manner the <hi>Atheist</hi> here prooveth the soule not to be immortall, because <hi>the dead do not know any thing.</hi> But though the dead do not know any thing that is done upon the earth themselves being gone from the earth, for as <hi>St. Gregory</hi> speaketh <hi>sicut hi qui adhuc viventes sunt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregorius.</note>
                     <hi>mortuorum animae quo loco habeantur igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: ita mortui vitam in carne viventium postea qualiter disponatur ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciunt, quia &amp; vita spiritus longe est à vita carnis, &amp; sicut corpora &amp; incorporea diversa sunt genere, ita etiam distincta cognitione,</hi> As they who are yet living doe not know in what place and condition the soules of the dead are so the dead doe not know how they that are living in the flesh are, disposed of in there lives after themselves are gone; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the life of the spirit is fare different from the life of the flesh, and as coporeal and incorporeal things are diverse in their kind and nature, so are they in their knowledge. Notwithstanding the wicked being dead doe know the torments which they suffer for their mispent lives, they know the happinesse which they have left by the ill spending of them; they know how false it is, that being alive they thought the dead not to know any thing. <hi>Neither have they any reward:</hi> here is their denyall of the last judgement, and that it is which because they would not have to be, they say shall never be, and this it is to which a custome of sinning doth often bring wicked men at last. For as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writer noteth,<note place="margin">Caesarius Arelat. Hom. <hi>29</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>habet hoc infelix peccandi consuetudo, ut quantò amplius unusquisque peccaverit, tanta minus peccata ipsò intelligat, &amp; tantò eum plus peccare delectet: &amp; quando subrepit peccandi delectatio, statim futuri judicii diem abscondit oblivio,</hi> The unhappy custome of sinning hath this in it, that by how much the more any one sinneth, by so much the lesse he understandeth his sins, and by so much the more is delighted in sinning: and when a delight of sinning is crept into any one, forthwith forgetfulnesse hideth the day of judgement that is to come. But let every one take heed of this; for as <hi>St. Austin</hi> speaketh, <hi>Irremediable periculum est,</hi> it is a remedilesse danger for any one so to give the reines unto his vices and lusts, that he remembreth not that he must give accompt to God.<note place="margin">Augustin. de Temp.

                     <hi>Puto quod magna sit jam peccati poena, metum ac memoriam futuri judicii perdidisse,</hi> I think that it is a great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment even now of wickednesse, to have lost the feare and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the judgement to come. <hi>For the memory of them is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten:</hi> here they deny God himself to be, and because the memory of the dead is forgotten with men, therefore they think that there is no God, by whom they are remembred. And this it is indeed, which incenseth the wrath of God against the wicked, For as <hi>St. Bernard</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>(wherein doth the wicked provoke God)</hi> wherein doth he make his anger to be bitter against him?<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> Not for his fornications, not for his

                     <hi>God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it, he hideth his face, he will never see it?</hi> This it is which maketh God to make his arrowes drunken in their blood. For as <hi>Ruper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> also speaketh, <hi>Non ex quo quisque peccat,</hi>

                     <hi>quantum amor habet de ratione boni;</hi> So that hatred hath so much of evill in it, as love hath of goodnesse, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath it. Now love is due unto God simply, unto man it is due only according to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and to grace. For in respect of that which a man hath either from himself, or from the devill, that is in respect of sin, and the defect of righteousnesse, so it is not due unto him. And therefore it is lawfull to hate sinne in man, and whatsoever else appertaineth to the defect of divine righteousnesse: But either the nature or the grace of any man, another cannot hate without sinne. Whereas this very thing that any one doth hate in another, either wickednesse or want of goodnesse, is indeed rather a loving of him. For it is the same thing to desire the good of another, and to hate that which is evill for him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to speak simply of the hatred of another, it is alwayes with sinne. Thirdly <hi>envy</hi> is a sorrow for the good of another as it is esteemed to be his owne evill, and a diminishing of his good in whom it is. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15.</note>
                     <hi>that he was unto God a sweete odour in Christ in them that are saved, and in them that perish, Anselmus</hi> saith of it, Some did love <hi>S. Paul,</hi> others did envy him, they who did love him did live by the sweete odour, they that did envy him did perish by the sweete odour;<note place="margin">Anselmus.</note>
                     <hi>Ideo pereuntibus non malus odor sed bonus erat inde en: magis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videbant quia tam bona gratia praevalebat,</hi> To them that did perish he was not a bad odour but a good: for therefore did they envy him the more, because the good grace of God was so strong in him. But the good of one is apprehended to be the evill of another two wayes. First, when one is sorry for the good of another in respect of the danger of some hurt, which from thence hangeth over himself: as when a man is sorry for the advancement of his enemy, fearing least he should doe him hurt.<note place="margin">Aristotel. Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note> Now such a sadnesse is not envy, but rather an effect of feare, as the Philosopher saith. Secondly the good of one is esteemed to be anothers evill, in regard that it diminished his glory and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: and thus is envy sorry for the good of another. And therefore men for the most part doe envy those good things, in which is glory, and in which men love to be honoured and reckoned of, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher also sheweth. But that which wee may farther note in this verse, is that <hi>the love, hatred, and envy of wicked men doe not perish</hi> untill themselves perish and dye: while themselves have a part in any thing that is done under the Sun, these have still a part in them. For indeed these things are of a tenacious nature. <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>pondus animae,</hi> the weight of the soule, as one calleth it, and draweth not only the will, but the memory, the understanding of man to that which is loved: <hi>quia ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil aliud vel meminisse vel cogitare valet, nisi illud cujus amore fervescit,</hi> Because he can neither remember nor think of any thing but only of that with the love whereof he is inflamed.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 32.27.</note>
                     <hi>Hatred</hi> also is so hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved that it is sometimes spoken of as continuing after death. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> speaketh of some, <hi>who are gone downe to hell with their weapons of warre, and they have laid their swords under their heads.</hi> And
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:177008:157"/> surely such is the deadly hatred of some, that when they dye, they may seeme to cary it with them. <hi>Chrysologus</hi> noteth of the rich glutton who would have <hi>Lazarus</hi> to bee sent unto him, that being still cruell towards <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he would have him to be sent,<note place="margin">Chrysolog.

Lastly <hi>envy</hi> sticketh so close to the hearts of the wicked, that as <hi>Cassian</hi> noteth, <hi>Ʋs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que adeo incurabilis est ista pernicies ut blandimentis exasperetur, infletur obsequiis, muneribus irritetur: quanto en: alius amplius aut humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis subjectione, aut patientiae virtute, aut munificentiae laude profece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, tanto ille majoribus invidiae stimulis incitatur,</hi>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. Some understand these words to be still spoken by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and to be delivered by the Preacher in their person, and then to give the meaning of them in S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> words, it is as if they said, <hi>O homo quia ergo post mortem nihil es,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>&amp; mors ipsa nihil, audi consilium meum, dum vivis in hâc brevi vitâ fruere voluptate, utere dapibus, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no curas opprime, &amp; intellige quoniam à Deo nobis data sunt ad utendum.</hi> O man because therefore after death thou art nothing, and death it self is nothing, follow my counsell, enjoy thy pleasure, use danity meats, drowne thy cares with wine, and understand that the things of this life are given us of God to be used by us. But I conceive that the Preacher here doth rather resume the speaking to himself, and therefore so to consider the words, perhaps at a sudden view the words may seeme to say no more then the common saying hath, <hi>Inter caenandum hilaris esto,</hi> be merry at meate. But doubtlesse more serious and deepe were the Preachers thoughts. Neither doe I think that it is only a moderation in eating and drinking that is here prescribed: although it be well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Saint Hierome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>Quod non habeat veram laetitiam &amp; cor bonum qui creaturis suprà modum abutitur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. Ibid.</note> that he hath not true joy nor a good merry hart, who by excesse abuseth the creatures. But this may be noted here, that it is not an eating to beget joy, nor a drinking of wine to breed a merry hart that is spoken of by the Preacher. For though ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of bread may strengthen the spirits, and though wine may cheere them; according as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> sheweth, who saith that wine being drunke maketh a man <hi>sibi ipsi aequum &amp; clementem, convivis sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem,</hi>

                     <hi>famulis mitiorem, amicis jucundiorem,</hi> favourable and gentle to himselfe, delightfull to them that are with him, mild to his servants, pleasant to his friends notwithstanding it is but a poore mirth that is so gotten; vanishing with the fumes of the wine, and followed many times by sadnesse that comes after it. That therefore which is here spoken of, is an eating with joy, a drinking of wine with a merry hart, so that the joy and the mirth doe as it were prepare the stomack, thereby to make the nourishment to doe the more good, and to make him that receiveth it, the more forward and hearty in blessing and praising God for it.<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> In a spirituall sense, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, that these words, <hi>Goe thy way, eate thy bread with joy, and drinke thy wine with a merry hart.

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>John.</hi> 7.37.</note> is the voice of that Preacher, who in the Gospell saith, if any man thirst, let him come to mee and drinke: and who in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Proverbs</hi> 9.5.</note>
                     <hi>Come eate of my bread and drinke of the wine that I have mingled.</hi> It is also a good spirituall meaning which <hi>Lyra</hi> giveth to the words, who taking them to be spoken to the righteous man saith, goe thy way that is <hi>vade juste,</hi> Goe thy way thou righteous man, <hi>eate thy bread with joy and drinke thy wine with a merry hart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> that is, <hi>vive in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunditate mentis ex testimonio bonae conscientiae procedente,</hi> live in cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of mind proceeding from the testimony of a good conscience. But to give that meaning to the words which I apprehend them to carry. The Preacher having spoken much of the confusions and outrages that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:177008:158"/> are in this world, and drawing this matter to a conclusion wisheth us not trouble our minds with the care of those things: but rather to use things present with cherefulnesse and quietnesse and as for those things, which fall out in this life, to let them goe as they come. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to shew the connexion of this verse, to that which is immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely before it. The Preacher having before shewed how wicked men from the consideration of death, did in rheir lives set themselves wholy to the enjoying of sensuall and sinfull delights, in a voluptuous using of the creatures, here he sheweth that a cheerefull delight is not forbidden unto men, nor is a comfortable use of the creatures by God denyed them. And therefore he saith <hi>Goe thy way,</hi> take the one, use the other, <hi>eate thy bread with joy, drinke thy wine with a merry hart.</hi> For seeing <hi>that God accepteth thy works,</hi> there is nothing that needeth to trouble thee, or to make thee sad. What though the world may set it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee? what though malitious enemies may be thy persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? what though the devill fighteth against thee? there shall no hurt come unto thee: and therefore let not any thing make thee to eate thy bread with sadnesse, or to drinke thy wine with heavinesse. Let him refuse his meate, or take it with care, let him drinke his wine with anguish of hart, that liveth wickedly and whose wayes doe not please God: but let him whose works are accepted by God, ever be merry, ever cherefull. It is the fashion of many to be merry and glad, when there works are accepted by men, and that by them they are well thought of: but this is a faint and not a solid mirth. Then there is true joy and a harty mirth, when God accepteth the works that are done, and is well pleased with the doers of them. <hi>Moyses</hi> putting his hand into his bosome took it out Leprous, putting it againe into his bosome he tooke it out cleane. This is a right embleme of that which befalleth man. For the hand is the instrument of working, and the works of men are sometimes Leprous and unsound, sometimes healthy and good. And this proceedeth from the bosome, from the hart of man. For if they proceed from a sincere and honest hart, which God approoveth, then are they sound and healthy; if they come from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hart, and be done for the pleasing of men, then are they Leprous and unsound. Now it is an healthy and sound body that is fittest for mirth and freest in mirth, it is a healthy and sound body that eateth and drinketh most cheerefully. Wherefore seeing where God accepteth thy works, there is health and soundnesse, let there also be freenesse of joy and mirth. In the law the Priest was first to flay the sacrifice, and to pull off the skin of it, and then to wash the entrayles, and so to offer it unto God. Now this did shew,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.6.9.</note> how man was to make himselfe an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable sacrifice to God, the skin is first to be pulled off, our sins are first to be confessed and laid open unto God; and them the inwards are to be washed, our harts are to be cleansed from the foulnesse of hypocrisy, our understanding our will and affections are to be washed from those staines that stick unto them; and so they being offered to God, then
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:177008:159"/> may he eate his peace offering with joy, and drinke his wine with a merry heart, for now <hi>God accepteth his works,</hi> now God is pleased with his works of joy and mirth, when that the works of his life doe please God. The Swan is of a white faire colour and a goodly bird to looke upon, being of no small accompt with men; but yet it was by Gods law to the Jewes forbidden to be eaten.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Levitic.</hi> 11.18.</note> The reason of it is given to be, because whereas the feathers are so white and comely, the flesh under them is black and hard. For such things were forbidden to the Jewes to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy unto them how they should keepe themselves from sinne which those things did represent. Now such are they who in the outward shew of their lives doe please men, but are not in their works accepted by God. And surely such as themselves are, such is the joy and the mirth that they have, it doth but make a faire shew; the bread that they eate, the wine that they drinke is but like the flesh of a Swan in the stomack, and hard to be digested. There is a black sadnesse within, though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the whitenesse of mirth appeareth. He singeth the Swans song, his joy is sweete even when death appeareth, the inward sincerity of whose heart maketh his works to be accepted by God: let him therefore while he liveth eate his bread with joy and drinke his wine with a cheerefull heart. This the wicked seeke for, this they desire to doe, who have little reason for it: this is offered to the Godly, and none have such good cause to embrace it.</p>

But to consider it, as I have the former verse, and as the Preachers owne counsell, <hi>Let thy garments be alwayes white:</hi> by the garments I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the affections of the soule, which being ill ordered, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids us to put off, saying, <hi>put off all these, anger, malice, wrath:</hi> which being well ordred the same Apostle bids us to put on saying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Caloss.</hi> 3.8. <hi>v.</hi> 12</note>
                     <hi>put on therefore, as the elect of God holy and beloved, bowels of mercy, kindnesse, humblenesse of mind, meekenesse, long suffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another.</hi> The meaning therefore of the Preacher is, let thine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be alwayes white, that is alwayes cheerefull, for white is a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full colour: yea let them be so alwayes, even when persecution is hottest upon thee, and most cruell against thee. This was the disposition of the Apostles,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts.</hi> 5.41.</note> of whom being beaten wee read, that they departed from the presence of the councill, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus. And this hath been the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many glorious martyrs, who with cheerefulnesse of affections have layd downe their lives for Christs sake: when their garments have
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:177008:159"/> been stayned with their owne blood, they have still kept white the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cheerefulnesse in their affections. Whereupon Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Quam bonus est Dominus pro quo dulces &amp; injuriae &amp; grata mors:</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; benè grata quae acquirit immortalitatem,</hi> How good is the Lord for whose sake even wrongs are sweete, and death is acceptable: and well is it acceptable which obtaineth immortality. <hi>And let thine head lack no oyntment:</hi> they are the words of Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> upon occasion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other passage of Scripture, where he mentioneth also these words, <hi>Quid per caput nisi ea quae principale unius cujusque actionis est mens ipsa signatur?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregor. Moral. lib. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>26.</hi>
                     </note> what by the head is signified but that which is the principall thing of every action, the mind it selfe? wherefore as in the former part of the verse, by the garments I understood the affections, so here by the head I understand the thoughts of the mind. As for the <hi>oyntment</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> tels us, <hi>sciendum est naturam hanc esse olei,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hierony. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>ut &amp; lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alat, &amp; fessorum resolvat laborem.</hi> It is to be knowen that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of oyle is this, that it nourisheth the light, and refresheth, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the wearyed. By oyntment therefore a cherefulnesse also is set forth unto us, for that is lightsome and giveth light to the mind, that refresheth the mind wearyed with study and meditation. So that the meaning of the Preacher is, let there be wanting no cheerefulnesse in thy thoughts; but anoynt thy thoughts with a joyfull and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full remembrance of Gods mercies towards thee, anoynt thy thoughts with a glad consideration of the gracious promises of Gods goodnesse, which in their good time shall be accomplished.

All chastity it cleane: but perhaps all is not white, or else it is not white alwayes. Of virginity therefore it is well said, <hi>Let thy garments alwayes be white.</hi> Another application which Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> makes of this whitenesse is, <hi>Non sit tempus in quo candida non habeas vestimenta, cave nequando pollutis vestibus induaris: populus quippe peccator in fuscis vestibus luxisse describitur,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Rabbi Solomon.</note> saith here; that this is like unto a King inviting one unto a feast, and not tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him the set time; and therefore that he who is invited, if he be wise doth so fit and adorne himselfe that at any time he may be ready. Now God calleth the elect to that feast, which is to come, and doth not tell them the certaine time, which is the time of death, then which nothing is more uncertaine, and therefore a man must be alwayes ready that he may be admitted unto that feast.<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> And this readinesse is by a vertuous &amp; Godly life which is here signified by <hi>the white garments</hi> as <hi>Lyra</hi> addeth.

                     <hi>let thine head lack no oyntment,</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> briefly applyeth thus, <hi>esto miserecors</hi> be thou mercifull. And so Saint <hi>Gregory, oleum in capite est charitas in mente, &amp; deficit oleum a capite, quum charitas discedit à mente,</hi>

                     </note> Oyntment on the head is charity in the mind, and there is oyntment lacking on the head, when charity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from the mind. Let therefore thine head, that is thy mind, (which is said to be the head, as <hi>Lyra</hi> noteth, <hi>quia caput est in viribus animae,</hi> because it is the head and principall facultie among the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the soule,) let thy mind study where help and charity may be wanting, let it study how to shew charity in the best manner, and for the most good. For it is usuall in Scripture by oyle or ointment to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a mercifull charity, in respect of the softnesse and the sweetnesse of it. But how do the parts of the verse stand together? how can the garment be white, if the head be anoynted with oyle? Especially if there be much oyle, as the words, <hi>lack no oyntment</hi> may seeme to signify. For then it may well run down upon the garments, and running down it cannot choose but staine them, for oyle or oyntment is a very staining thing. It is true that a materiall oyle is so; but the oyle of a mercifull charity is of another nature, that doth not staine, but cleanseth and taketh away the staines of our sinne. God being ready to give unto them, who are ready to give unto the poore, the graces of his Holy Spirit, whereby to make them penitent of their sinnes, and to keepe them from sinne.</p>

How therefore should this so great neerenesse cause a great measure of love and affection between them. And indeed it is the love of one to the other, that maketh their life to be joyfull: according to the measure of the one, so is the measure of the other. <hi>All the dayes of the life of thy vanity:</hi> when man had first life given him, it was then a life of solidity, of stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and then his wife was given to him, as the Fathers speake <hi>in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium,</hi> for the office of nature; but afterwards by sinning, mans life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>a life of vanity,</hi> then his wife was given to him, as the Fathers also speake, <hi>in remedium,</hi> for a remedy.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:177008:161"/> it is for a remedy to be received. The Preacher therfore would have this remedy to be used with cheerfulnes. For as Phisick doth the more good where it meeteth with a cheerfull disposition, so this remedy is the more comfortable to man, where it is enjoyed with cherefulnes of heart. <hi>Which he hath given thee under the Sun:</hi> the word, <hi>which,</hi> as I conceive by the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, is to be referred unto wife, for it is God indeed, who was the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymphus,</hi> the friend of the bridegrome, that gave the first wife unto man, it was God who married them, and joyned them together, and it is God who still giveth the wife unto her husband, It is added, <hi>under the Sun,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Sun being the cōmon cause of generation, under the Sun, the husband &amp; the wife are the immediate causes of it, according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Philosopher, <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem,</hi> The Sun, and man do beget man.<note place="margin">Ambros. de Paradis. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>All the dayes of thy vanity:</hi> this sheweth that though there be a rejoycing in a wife, and a rejoycing not only allowed, but commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto man, yet it is but <hi>in the dayes of his vanity,</hi> and therefore but a vanity of rejoycing. S. <hi>Amb.</hi> considering those words, that God did cast a sleep upon <hi>Adam,</hi> when he formed woman out of him; thereupon saith, <hi>Quis est iste sopor?</hi> What is that sleep? but that when the mind is intent to the work of marriage, we seem, as it were to bend down our eyes to a kind of sleep of this world, <hi>&amp; paulisper obdormire divinis,</hi> and for a time to be asleep to heavenly things, while that we rest in earthly and worldly things. But that which I gather from <hi>Adams</hi> being asleep, is this, that it shewed the rejoycing which is in the wife, to be but as a dream that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, &amp; as a vanity, <hi>in the dayes of mans vanity. For that is thy portion in this life:</hi> but if that be the portion, the part of man in this life, thē it is not the part of a man, at least of a religious man, to speak of marriage, &amp; to slight it, as some of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doe. One saith, <hi>Moysen quia conjux fuit non potuisse ingredi terram promissionis;</hi>

As if they could not honor virginity unles they did dishonor marriage. But in this point <hi>Epiph.</hi> speaketh very well, <hi>Sancta Ecclesia virginitatem cum hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militate admiratur &amp; glorificat, viduitatem laudat, &amp; nuptiarum castum vinculum honorat &amp; suscipit,</hi> The holy Church with humility admireth and glorifieth virginity,<note place="margin">Epiphan. l. <hi>2.</hi> Haere. <hi>48.</hi>

But while thou art <hi>under the Sun,</hi> thou must be under the burden of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and in marriage thou must take care of breeding thy children, in governing thy servants, in ordering thine affaires. Of him that doth

Non est enim in morte aliqua sapientia, nullus post dissolutionem vitae hujus sensus,</hi> There is nothing more to be had, then to enjoy whatsoever may delight, take it quickly, least it be lost. For thou must not feare those frivolous devises: that there is after death an accompt to be given of every work, whither good or bad. There is is not in death any wisedome, after the dissolution of this life there is no sense of any thing. But in this verse I conceive the Preacher, to shew, that as the wicked from the consideration of death doe excite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to a diligent and earnest pursuing after the pleasures of this life; so from the same consideration the vertuous should be stirred up to a carefull diligence in doing of that which is needfull to be done. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thy hand findeth to doe:</hi> the hand findeth that which is within the reach of it, or els within the graspe of it, and therefore whatsoever thy hand findeth to doe, is whatsoever thou art able, whatsoever thou hast means to doe. <hi>Doe it with thy might:</hi> doe it according to thy might, thy strengh and ability, and let the measure and termination of thy working be the possibility of that which is to be wrought by thee. <hi>Saint Gregory</hi> considering these words, saith, <hi>quia ergo &amp; venturae mortis tempus ignoramus, &amp; post mortem operari non possumus,</hi>

                     <hi>superest ut ante mortem tempora indulta rapiamus.

For so it is that death when it commeth shall be conquered, if before it come it be alwayes feared. The diligence which the Father would have us to use, is to catch at every occasion, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:177008:162"/> to snatch at every opportunity of time which is continually lying before us, and not to let goe any thing that may be laid hold of. <hi>Saint Bernard</hi> therefore complayning of those, who while they live are negligent in working, and whose manner is to say, come let us talk together to passe away the time, with griefe of spirit saith: <hi>O donec praetereat hora, O donec pertranseat tempus, quod tibi ad agendam paenitentiam, ad obtinendam veniam,</hi>

Now what is mans life but a burning light, and so long as this light continueth to burne, God giveth us time of making our peace with him, and of providing for our safety: but this light being once extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, there is no more any light of knowledge, which may afford any comfort to us. <hi>In the grave whither thou goest:</hi> the vulgar Latin

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. The Preacher keeping himself unto his maine argument, which is to shew the vanity of the things of this world, saith,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>I retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and saw under the Sun,</hi> that is saith Lyra <hi>in habitatione hominum,</hi> in the dwellings of men. For God is said to have placed his tabernacle in the Sun, but men have their tabernacles under the Sun. <hi>That the race is not to the swift.</hi> Which in a fuller and plainer manner is well set
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:177008:163"/> downe by <hi>Olympiodorus,</hi> who saith, <hi>Aliud contemplatus sum, quod vincere in cursu, non sit cujusque levis &amp; expediti adcurrendum, neque omnium qui potentes sunt egregios ac invictos se praestare in praelio, neque ad prudentes sapientesque viros atque industrios divitiis devolvi, sed nec eos qui multa noverint,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Olympiodor. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>gratiam consequi,</hi> I considered another thing that to overcome in running is not the glory of every one, who is light and nimble in running, neither is it the triumph of all, who are mighty to make themselves victorious and conquerours in war, neither is it the happinesse of prudent wise and diligent men that riches are cast upon them, neither is it also the successe of those who know many things to find grace and favour. The drift of the Preacher is to shew that all the providence of man is uncertaine, and that after all care taken, much watching used, and all things made ready, yet when it comes to the point, even he that is most mighty, he that is most circumspect findeth that he hath not some thing that is necessary. And it is as if the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher had said, gather into one even all the gifts of humane nature, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speed, or valour, or wisdome, or industry, together with ability of all the arts and sciences, all these will faile when there is occasion of them, all these will confesse that they have not that which they are. And when it should appeare, what they are, the most swift shall not have the race, the most valiant shall not have valour, neither shall art science or diligence have their use and benefit. Surely he is a foole, who in the providence of man doth not see even those things which are most certaine and most ready to misse of their mark. And indeed from hence especially is shewed the providence of God, and that it is that alone which hath at hand all things necessary, and which therefore never faileth in the proposed end. When wee read of the <hi>Samaritane,</hi> who travelling by the way, and falling upon a wounded man, beeing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with compassion bound up his wounds, and powred wine and oyle into them. Doth it not seeme much that beeing but a traveller and passing on the way he should have wine and oyle in readinesse with him?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 10.</note> Suppose that he might cary wine with him, yet whence should he have oyle? Or suppose he might also carry oyle with him, because wee read that <hi>Jacob</hi> travelling by the way, and erecting a pillar powred oyle upon it: yet where had he things needfull for ligatures to bind up the wounds? Surely this <hi>Samaritane</hi> was not man but God, and that is plaine even from this alone that he had all things needfull for the cure prepared and in readinesse: whereas in the pinch of time either all things or many things would have been wanting unto humane Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.<note place="margin">Origen. Homil. <hi>34.</hi> in Luc.</note> Atleastwise as <hi>Origene</hi> speaketh, <hi>Ʋt scias quod secundum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiam Dei Samaritus iste descendit ut curraret eum qui inciderat in latrones, manifestè doceberis ex eo, quod secum habebat alligaturas, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum oleum, secum vinum,</hi> that thou mayest know that it was by Gods providence, that the <hi>Samaritane</hi> came downe for the curing of him who fell among theeves, thou shalt be taught it manifestly from hence because he had in readinesse by him bindings, in readinesse oyle, in
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:177008:163"/> readinesse wine. <hi>But time and chance happeneth to them all:</hi> that is saith <hi>Olympiodorus, incerti rerum eventus, nihilque est hominibus tanquam satis, nihil undique perfectum, nihil aequale, omniaque fere dissimili sine terminantur,</hi> the events of things are uncertaine,<note place="margin">Olympiod in hunc vers.</note> and there is nothing unto men that is as it were sufficient, there is nothing every way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, nothing that goeth on in an equall and like course, but all things almost in the issue have an end unanswerable to the beginnings &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. But here <hi>Aquinas</hi> noteth two things, first that this is not so spoken, <hi>quod omnia quae in eis fiunt sint casualia, sed quia in quolibet eorum aliquid casuale inveniri potest,</hi> not that all things which are done in them doe happen by chance, but because in every one of them there is somthing of chance which may bee found. Secondly he noteth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aquinas</hi> 1. <hi>Qu.</hi> 103. <hi>Ar.</hi> 5.</note>
                     <hi>quod ad ostendendum casualia secundum ordinem alicujus superioris causae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire non dicit simplicit er quod vidit casum in omnibus esse, sed dicit tempus &amp; casum quia scilicet secundum aliquem ordinem temporis casua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les defectus inveniuntur in rebus,</hi> that to declare casuall things to come to passe according to the ordering of some superiour cause, he doth not simply say, that he saw chance in all things but he saith <hi>time and chance,</hi> namely because it is according to some ordering of time, that casuall events are found to bee in things. And the reason also why casuall events are found in things is well given by <hi>Saint Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> who saith, <hi>Haec autem fiunt quia incerto statu feruntur omnia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>&amp; non est in praesenti retributio meritorum, sed in futuro,</hi> but these things are done, because all things are carryed on with an uncertaine condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and because it is not in this world, but in that which is to come, that there shall be a reward of worth and desert. So that by chance the Preacher intendeth nothing else but the disposing of things by God, wherein man is uncertaine altogether and ignorant what they will be in a more hidden sense which <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> calleth, secundum <gap reason="foreign">

Now that is a time indeed on which the welfare of man doth principally depend, and for which he ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be alwayes ready, seeing he doth not know the time when it shall be. Wherefore <hi>Saint Bernand</hi> saith, <hi>Miser quare omni hora te non disponis?</hi>

Quod eum adhuc hodie licet bene agere scimus, utrum cras liceat ignoramus,</hi> let no one be negligent in the journy of this life, least he loose his place of abode in his country. For we know that we may doe good, while it is yet to day, but we know not whither we shall be able to morrow. But to consider the reading of our translation, which is according to the Originall. The ignorance of man in not knowing his time is more then of beasts.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jeremy.</hi> 8.7.</note> For the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> saith, <hi>the stork in the heaven knoweth his appointed times, and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe there comming.</hi> In <hi>Cassiodore</hi> King <hi>Theodoric</hi> shewing the same saith, <hi>Mergi quibus nomen est ex facto, cohabitatores piscium, aquatiles volucres futuras tempestates naturaliter praevidentes sicca petunt, stagna derelinquunt,</hi> The Mergi, (we take them for the Cormorant) who have their name from their deed, the cohabitants of fishes and water fowles; for seeing naturally tempests that are to come, leave the lakes and get to drye places.<note place="margin">Cassiodorus Var. l. <hi>3.</hi> Var. <hi>48.</hi>
                     </note> He speaketh also of the <hi>Echini:</hi> a kind of fish, who are as he describeth them, <hi>mella carnalia, constatilis teneritudo, croceae delitiae divitis maris, dum futuras tempestates agnoverint loca mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare cupientes, quia illis prae levitate corporis nandi nulla fiducia est, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillos quibus pares esse possint complexi, quadam anchorarum pondera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione librati; scopulos petunt, quos fluctibus vexandos esse non credunt,</hi> a fleshy hony, a firm softnesse, the saffron delights of the rich sea, when they perceive tempests to be comming, desiring to chang their places, because they trust not to their owne swimming in regard of the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their body, they take unto them little stones, such as they may be able to rule and master, and being poised by them as it were by the weight of anchors, they get unto the rocks, which they beleive the waves will not be able to disquiet. Thus these creatures herein may seeme to excell man, who is a creature far more excellent then they. But the reason why man knoweth not his time, is, that he may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God to be the ruler of his time, and may depend rather upon his providence then upon his owne strengh and circumspection.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.14.15.</note> Wherefore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I trusted in thee O Lord, I said thou art my God. My times are in thy hands.</hi> Which is as if he said, it is not in my care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:177008:164"/> not in myne inventions, not in the projects of the discourse of my mynd, that the event of myne affaires, my good and happinesse are placed: but in thy hands O Lord, thy will, thy judgement for these are the hands of the Lord, by which he worketh. <hi>As the fishes that are taken in an evill net:</hi> first the net is said to be evill, because evill for them, as the French translation addeth to make the sense plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And so doth <hi>Tremellius</hi> expound it saying, <hi>Damnoso sibi &amp; ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitoso,</hi> a net evill and hurtfull and dangerous to themselves: But it may be also called an evill net, as being a net of deceipt and prey, and as shewing those things to be evill in men. Secondly by their speach the Preacher hath reference to what he had said before in the former vers: for fishes are swift in their course of swimming, but meeting with a net are stopped in their way, so that the slow paced worme doth often out goe them, even as he that is swift in running meeting with some accident that he knew not of, leaveth the race to him that in swiftnesse came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. <hi>And as the birds that are caught in the snare:</hi> this also hath reference unto the former verse. For as birds whose wings are ready to carry them on high meeting with a snare are kept below and hindred in their flight, so that the butterfly gets up higher then they; even so men of skill are forward by their skill to fly into favour, but meeting with some event not thought upon by them they are kept below and out of favour, when some others of lesse skill have more favour then then they. <hi>So are the sons of men snared in an evill time: Philo</hi> shews it in them who are strong and win not the battel saying, <hi>athletae robore freti &amp; bona corporis habitudine, dum certam sibi pollicentur victoriam, vel exclusi sunt è certamine, vel victi ab adversariis: alii ne secundam quidem palmam sperantes primam coronam reportaverunt praemium</hi> wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlers furnished with strength and enjoying a good disposition of body, while they promise themselves a certaine victory, are either excluded from the game or conquered by there adversaries:<note place="margin">Philo de Joseph.</note> others who did not so much as hope for the second garland, have carried away the first crowne as their reward. He shews also <hi>that riches are not to men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, quidam negotiatores certa lucra sibi proponunt, securi de pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculis; alii de damno soliciti magnum fecerunt operae pretium,</hi> Some merchandising dealers propose unto themselves by their understanding certaine gaines, and are secure of dangers, which yet they fall into: others are much troubled with feare of their losses, who come to great gaines. <hi>When it falleth suddenly upon them:</hi> that is unlookt for, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of, unknowne altogether. For as <hi>Philo</hi> speaketh, <hi>qui vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, quantum ad incertam perceptionem attinet nihil a dorminentibus dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferunt, seipsos fallendo, dum seputant rerum naturas clare perspicere,</hi> they who are watchfull, for as much as pertaineth to an uncertaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, doe not differ any thing from them that are asleepe, by deceiving themselves,<note place="margin">Philo. Ibid.</note> while they think themselves to perceive certainly the nature of things. Againe he saith, <hi>proinde tanquam altum dormien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes erramus, non valentes quicquam ratiocinatione vel penetrare vel certo
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:177008:165"/> comprehendere, quando cuncta umbris spectrisque sunt similia,</hi> wee are therefore like those that are a sleepe, not being able by reasoning to peirce into any thing, or certainely to comprehend it, when all things are like to shadows and phantasies. But this ignorance of man in not knowing his time, and this uncertanity of humane events, must make him in wisedome to provide even for those things which he doth not feae nor look for.<note place="margin">Cassiodor. l. <hi>3.</hi> var. <hi>48.</hi>

Least hereupon there might be some disesteeme of the worth of wisdome, or some neglect in the painfull getting of it: the Preacher here also sheweth, the excellent use and the glorious benefit of it, and with all the remarkable Providence of God in blessing of it. <hi>This wisdome have I seen also:</hi> he doth at once both shew it to others, and look himselfe upon it.

How many notorious fooles are there, who spend all their time care paines in getting of riches, and neglect that one thing which is necessary, the salvation of their soules? How many shamefull fooles are there, who having great riches, and might with a litle of them laid out in charity purchase the glory of heaven, doe by their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse spend their means to sell themselves to destruction? How many silly fooles are there, who thinke a little crying, God pardon me, to be repentance enough, and that they can make their peace with God, when and how they will, as if the Father had left times and seasons in their power and not in his owne? Indeed who can number the follies of men, and the fooles that are among men?

For as the Sun excelleth among the planets and starres of heaven, and is as it were the eye of the world; so wisdome excelleth among all the gifts of the soule, and is as it were the inward eye of the little world man. For as <hi>Philo</hi> speaketh <hi>visus mentis nihil aliud est quam prudentia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philo lib. de Abrahamo.</note> the sight of the mind is nothing else but wisdome. <hi>And it seemed great unto mee:</hi> the vulgar Latin saith, <hi>maxima</hi> very great, even so great is the beauty of it upon the earth, as the glory of the Sun in heaven.

                     <hi>&amp; inter opes divinas citra controversiam pulcherrima,</hi> pretious is wisdome and among the divine riches, without controversie the most beautifull. Most beautifull it is among the divine riches, most need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is among humane blessings. For as the same writer speaketh, <hi>sicut nostris corporibus interitum morbus, incolumitatem affert sanitas; it idem animas prudentia servat, quum ipsa sit mentis sanitas; imprudentia vero interimit quum sit morbus eorum insanabilis,</hi> as sickenesse bringeth destruction to our bodyes,<note place="margin">Philo de Temu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia.</note> health safety; in like manner wisdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth our soules, seeing that is the health of the mind, but folly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth them, seeing it is the incurable disease of them. <hi>Moyses</hi> speaking to the <hi>Israelites</hi> concerning their going into the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and saying when yee shall come into the, land and shall have planted all manner of trees for food,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Levitic.</hi> 19.23.</note> thereupon <hi>Philo</hi> noteth, that while they staid without that land, they were not able to plant such trees. And he according to his manner fetching out a mysticall sense from it addeth upō it, <hi>donec enim in sapientiae viā mens intrat non progreditur, sed errabunda vagatur, sylvestres tantum modo curat arbores, quae vel in totum steriles sunt, vel fructum ferunt ad cibos incommodum. Sed quando in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressae viam sapientiae, per decreta ejus ascendit, &amp; incepit in his omnibus decurrere; tum mites &amp; mitium fructuum colit feraces pro illis sylvestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, tranquillitatem pro perturbationibus pro ignorantia scientiam, pro malis bona,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philo de plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione Noe.</note> for untill the mind entreth into the way of wisdome, it doth not go forward, but gadding wandreth up and downe, planteth only wild trees, which either are barren, or else bring forth that fruit which is not good to eate. But when it is come into the way of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it ascendeth up by the rules thereof, and beginneth to run a course
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:177008:166"/> according to all these rules, then it planteth better trees, and such as bring forth better fruit, instead of those wild trees, quietnesse instead of perturbations, knowledg insteed of ignorance, good things instead of evill. Lastly the Preacher saith, <hi>unto mee</hi> it seemed great: for it is the wisdome of another that the Preacher speaketh of, it is not his owne. <hi>Gregory</hi> saith <hi>Omnis cui sapientia recta est, plurima non est,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregor. Morab. lib. <hi>17.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note> every one whose wisdome is right, doth never thinke it to be great being his owne, if it be right, it never seemeth to be great unto him; but the wisdome of another he seeth to be great. <hi>Ʋnto mee</hi> saith the Preacher <hi>it seemed to be great;</hi> and as it seemed to him, so it seemeth to every one that hath wisdome and understanding, though perhaps others may sleight it, a foole may despise it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. <hi>Rabbi Solomon</hi> saith <hi>Lyra</hi> expoundeth this verse, <hi>tanquam sic fuerit ad literam,</hi> as if there had been some such City on the earth,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> and that it was so besieged, so delivered, as here it is set downe; but he sheweth not either how the City was named or how the King was called. It matters not for the scope of the Preacher, whether it were so or no, there being Cities on the earth great and little, and enemies that doe beseige them with great forces, this is sufficient ground for that which is said. But when we speake of Cities and of citizens, it is not amisse to remember, that this is only according to the speach of man, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of them, of whom as they are compared one with another, some are said to be of one City, some of another, some are said to be citizens, some are not: whereas in truth as <hi>Philo</hi> speaketh, <hi>Solus Dominus Deus civis est, omnis autē creatura inquilinus &amp; advena;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Philo lib. de Cherub.</note>
                     <hi>qui vero dicuntur cives per abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum nominis magis quam verè sic appellantur,</hi> the Lord God alone is a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, every creature is a foreigner and stranger, they that are called citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are so tearmed, rather by an abuse of the name, then properly and truly. For indeed the whole world and all things therein, as they are the works of God, so they are his possessions, which he lendeth unto men, because himselfe hath not need of them. But he that doth use them, doth not possesse them, because there is one owner and master of all, who rightly saith the whole earth is myne, and yee are strangers and sojourners in it. And this is not onely most true, but most usefull for comfort. For because men doe think the things of the earth to be their owne, therefore are they full of sorrow, when they are taken from them: whereas did they thinke themselves to be strangers to them, the losse of them would be the lighter to them. But to consider the City here spoken of. This verse sheweth the great ods, that is betweene the defendants and the assailants; for that is the basenesse of oppression, that it alwayes worketh upon great inequality. <hi>There was a little City, Et ideo poterat de facili obsideri,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> and therefore it might be besieged easily: <hi>and few men in it, &amp; ideo male poterat defendi,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could be hardly defended saith <hi>Lyra;</hi> yea the few men that were in it, were but <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="340" facs="tcp:177008:167"/> sick and diseased. <hi>And there came a great King against it,</hi> not only a King, but a great King, great in his dominions, and being a King of many countreys, he came against one, and that one a little citie. <hi>And besieged it,</hi> besieged a few men with a great armie, with very many men, and encompassed them round, that at least they might perish by famine. <hi>And built great bulwarks against it:</hi> bulwarks as great as the little citie, and even little cities in themselves, being built as habitations for the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to dwell in: These were the uneven tearms upon which the war was made, and what greater disadvantage could a poore little citie have. But taking the Preacher to speak metaphorically, the application which the <hi>Jews</hi> make of it, is by <hi>the little citie,</hi> here to understand man as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> to understand the body of man, as <hi>Lyra</hi> saith, By <hi>the few men in the citie,</hi> to understand, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>membra de quibus ipse homo contexitur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> the parts of which man is composed; to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the members of the body, as <hi>Lyra</hi> saith. By <hi>the great King that came against it,</hi> to understand, as <hi>Lyra</hi> saith, <hi>Ipsum fomitem ad malum incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantem, qui rex magnus dicitur, eo quod multi obediunt ei,</hi> the corruption of man which inclineth him to evill, which is said to be a great King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many doe obey it. I have noted this difference betweene Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Lyra,</hi> in relating the exposition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is perceieved how <hi>Lyra</hi> would draw the <hi>Jews</hi> to maintaine the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the auncient School-men, who placed originall corruption principally in the depravation of the sensitive part which is seated in the body.<note place="margin">Philo de sacrif. Abel. &amp; Cain.</note> But that Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> relateth the opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> more truly appeareth from <hi>Philo,</hi> from whose ground, it may be that the exposition is taken; for hee saith, <hi>in uniuscujusque nostrum ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate quae constat ex animo &amp; corpore, pro firmissimo propugnaculo sunt cogitationes amicae prudentiae,</hi> in the citie of every one of us, which consisteth of a soule and a body, a most firme and strong tower are those thoughts, which are the friends of wisdome. The application, which Christian writers make of the passage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture metaphorically taken,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32.</note> is, by <hi>this little citie</hi> here to understand the Church of Christ, which our Saviour himselfe calleth a little flock. For as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> noteth, in the Scripture a citie, a spouse, and sheepe doe signifie one and the same thing: and that the Church is said to be <hi>civitas propter collectionem, sponsa propter dilectionem, oves propter man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudinem,</hi> a citie in regard of their unitie and gathering together, a Spouse in respect of the love of Christ towards her, and sheepe in regard of meeknesse and mildnesse.<note place="margin">Bernard.

                     <hi>and I saw the holy citie, the new Jerusalem comming downe from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</hi> The Church then is the citie of God,<note place="margin">Aug. de Civit. Dei. l. <hi>11.</hi> princ.</note>

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:177008:167"/> the faithfull members of Christ, which in respect of unbeleevers are indeed a very few. By <hi>the great King</hi> comming against it, and which besieged it, is understood the devill and his warfare against the Church of Christ. Who is said to be great, <hi>non quod magnus sit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hierony. in hunc vrrs.</note>
                     <hi>sed quod magnum se esse jactitet,</hi> Not because he is great, but because he boasteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be great, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh. But perhaps more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Preachers meaning in this place, we may apply <hi>this citie</hi> unto vertue, which though of great worth, yet is of <hi>litle</hi> command. This ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it is, which as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh, doth not glory in it selfe, but glorieth in the Lord: this citie it is, which doth not seek her owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but whose glory is God in the testimony of a good conscience; this citie it is, which doth not in glory lift up her owne head;<note place="margin">Aug. de Civit. Dei. l. <hi>15.</hi>
                     </note> but saith unto God, Thou art my glory, and the lifter up of my head, this is that citie, <hi>quem non fecit amor sui usque ad contemptum Dei, sed quem fecit amor Dei usque ad contemptum sui,</hi> Which is not built by a love of a mans self, even to the contempt of God, but by a love of God, even to a contempt of mans selfe. <hi>The few</hi> within this citie, are the few lovers, and followers of vertue. <hi>The great King</hi> which commeth against it, is vice, the greatnes of whose dominion is extended far and wide, and which besiegeth vertue, with the bulworks of affronts &amp; tēptations, which it raiseth up against it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. <hi>Now there was found in it a poore wise man:</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reads it, and so the Hebrew is, <hi>et invenit in ea,</hi> and he found in it, as if it were to be referred to the great King, and did upbrayd him, that when he came with so great an army against so litle a citie, he found one man in it to be able to withstand him, and to defend the citie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. The Originall word here used for a poore man, is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and signifieth him, who of his owne is so unable to helpe others, that he needeth help from others: which is here elegantly used, as shewing, that he who was not able to helpe others with his riches, yet was able to helpe them with his wisdome, and as implying, that though he needed the help of others for his reliefe, yet that they needed his helpe for their deliverance. For though he were <hi>a poore man,</hi> yet he was <hi>a wise man. Philo</hi> shewing the judgement of the world, saith,<note place="margin">Philo de Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num mutatione.</note>
                     <hi>Stultus omnis existi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat pecuniis abundantem, externisque facultatibus affluentem, statim con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectum &amp; prudentem esse; atque ut summatim dicam, prudentiam in re fortuita collocat, quum contra fortuitum in prudentia statuendum esset. Aequum est enim ut quod instabile est a stabili regatur,</hi> Every fool thinketh him who hath store of money, and aboundeth in outward estate, to be forthwith a prudent and a wise man: and that I may speak briefly, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth wisedome in that, which is a thing of chance, whereas things of chance ought to be placed in wisedome. For it is just that that which is uncertaine, should be ruled by that which is setled. But indeed, there is none that can be a wise man, unlesse he be a vertuous man: for all the vertues being linked together, and wisedome being the bond in which they are tied, a wise man and a vertuous man cannot but be joyned also, wherefore that which Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith of the just man, is true of the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:177008:168"/> wise man,<note place="margin">Ambros. de Abel &amp; Cain. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>

                     <hi>quam beata civitas quae plurimos justos habet, quam celebrabilis ore omnium, quomodo benedicetur tota de parte, &amp; beatus atque perpetuus ejus status existimatur?</hi> How blessed is that citie which hath many righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous people in it, how famous is it in the mouthes of all, how is the whole blessed from a part, and how happy and established is the state of it accounted to bee? One such righteous man, one such wise man, is able in danger to deliver a City, for so it followeth. <hi>And he by his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome delivered the citie:</hi> In <hi>Plautus, Seragastio,</hi> a servant asking another, <hi>ut munitum tibi visum est oppidum?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plautus ex Persa.</note> How doth the towne seeme to thee to be fortified: The answere which is given, is, <hi>si incolae bene sint morati pulchrè munitum arbitror,</hi> if the inhabitants be well governed and good, I thinke it to be well fortified: and then reckoning up many vices, hee concludeth, <hi>haec nisi inde aberunt, centuplex murus parum est servandis rebus,</hi> unlesse these things be absent, a hundred walls are but little for the preservation of it. And this it is which Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith, who speaking of the evills of mans mind, the evils of his life, the evills of his manners, addeth,<note place="margin">Aug. de Civita. Dei. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Quae ita magna sunt, ut his doctissimi eorum viri etiam stantibus urbibus respublicas perire confirment,</hi> Which are so great mischiefs, that by them the most learned among the heathen doe prove common-wealths to be ruinated, even while the cities are standing. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> also saith, <hi>Periturae urbis, aut malorum iminentum, vel futurae labis hoc pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum indicium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. de Abel &amp; Cain. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>si decedant viri consultores,</hi> the first signe of a citie ready to perish, or else of evils that doe hang over it, or of destruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to it, is this, if wise men, who are able to give direction and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell doe leave it, and by death depart from it. But one wise man, though a poore man, remaining in it, is able by his wisdome to deliver it; <hi>Yet no man remembred that same poore wise man:</hi> one would have thought that all should have rewarded him, yet such was their ingratitude, that there was <hi>no man that remembred him.</hi> No man that remembred the necessities of his want and povertie, who in their necessity had delivered the whole citie: no man that afforded him reliefe and succour out of that which he had, who by his wisedome had preserved unto all, all that they had: no man that honoured him, and gave unto him his due respect for it. Now what could be more unworthily done? What could shew people more shamefully wicked? For as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh, <hi>Nemo debet invidere alteri laudem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>quae sibi prosit; utque improbus quisque redemptorem suum dum suspicit frequenter imitatur: certe veneratur, plerumque diligit,</hi> No one ought to envie anothers praise, which is his owne profit, and every wicked person, while he respecteth his deliverer, often imitateth him; at leastwise honoureth him, and oftentimes loveth him. But some as being more then wicked, are so puft up in pride with the conceit of their owne wealth, that even their safety bestowed upon them, by a poore man is not regarded; and such also is the hard condition of poverty, that the good, which a poore man doth, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, not remembred. To apply now the applications, which were made of the former verse, unto this verse also. They who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:177008:168"/> the city to be the body of man, expound <hi>this poore man</hi> to be <hi>synderesin &amp; dictamen rationis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> the prescript and rule of reason incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto goodnesse, as <hi>Lyra</hi> setteth it downe, and which saith he is said to be poore, <hi>quia pauca obediunt ei,</hi> because they are few that doe obey it. They who expound the city to be the whole man, expound <hi>this poore man</hi> to be the inward man, who is indeed poore in spirit. And he it is that is not remembred by the outward man,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>nec subdit se consiliis ejus, sed rursum fruitur sua libera voluntate,</hi> neither doth subject himselfe unto his counsels, but taketh againe liberty to doe, as he will. They who expound the city to be the Church of Christ, understand <hi>the poore man</hi> to be Christ himself who for our sakes was made poore, and is not only wise but wisedome it self. He it is who delivereth his city his Church by his wisedome. How often saith Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> have we seen the Lyon with the forces of the world comming against the Church, and strongly besieging it, <hi>pauperis istius sapientia corruisse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> by the wisedome of that poore man to have failed in his enterprises, and to have been lost in them? But as the Father goeth on, when <hi>this poore man</hi> hath so prevailed, and peace hath been restored to the city, <hi>vix aliquis ejus meminit, vix aliquis illius mandata considerat,</hi> there is scarcely any one that doth remember him, scarcely any one that considereth his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, but giving themselves to pleasures and luxury seek after riches, which help not in the time of need, and in danger doe not deliver. Lastly if we expound the city to be vertue, we may expound also, <hi>the poore wise man</hi> to be wisedome it self, which is indeed the preserver of the vertues, and which is said to be poore because of the humility of it, whereby it seemes to it self alwayes to be litle. This poore man among the vertues themselves is many times forgotten when many, pleasing themselves with the good thing that is done, are not carefull to doe it wisely, whereby the goodnesse of it is lost and overthrowne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Then said I:</hi> he that hath prooved any thing may be bold to affirme it, and therefore in the verse before, the Preacher having shewed wisedome to be better then strength, here he is free to say it. But the Hebrew word (J) being set downe with an emphasis it implyeth that whatsoever others may or doe say, or whatsoever their opinion and judgement may be, <hi>I said,</hi> wisedome is better then strength. The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> translated strenght, may be taken either for courage as it is a vertue of the mynd, or els for the outward force of the body, and other outward might and power. In both acceptions it is true that wisedome is better. For wisedome is the chiefe of all the morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and whereas it is commonly said, that there are foure Cardinall or principall vertues <hi>Aquinas</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1.2.</note>
                     <hi>quod prudentia sit simpliciter princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pali omnibus, sed aliae ponuntur principales, unaquaeque in suo genere,</hi> that wisedome is absolutely the more principall then all the rest; and that the rest are set downe as principall in their kinds every one. The reason of it also is set downe by him: for seeing the good that is in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions consisteth in this, that they are regulated and ordered by
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:177008:169"/> the due rule, it is therefore necessary that humane vertue, which is the spring of good actions be placed in a drawing neere unto the rule of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions: Now the rule of humane actions is twofold, God and humane reason. God is the first rule, and by him humane reason is also to be regulated. Hence therefore it is that the divine vertues, which consist in attaining unto that first rule, because God himselfe is the object of them, are more excellent then either morall or intellectuall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which consist in attaining to the second rule of humane reason. Hence it is also that among the divine vertues, faith, hope, charity, the chiefe of these is charity because that doth respect God in a neerer man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then the other doe. For faith and hope doe respect God, <hi>secundum quod ex illo provenit nobis vel cognitio veri vel adeptio boni,</hi> as from him proceedeth unto us either a knowledge of some truth, or else the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of some good: but charity respecteth God, <hi>ut in ipso sistat, non ut ex eo aliquid nobis proveniat,</hi> that it may rest in God himselfe, not as from him is derived any thing to us. Hence therefore it is also that wisedome which respecteth humane reason, as in it self it is, is better then the rest of the morall vertues, which respect reason as from thence is taken, that which is the meane in humane actions and affections. As for fortitude in particular, as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith of it, <hi>quod fortitudo sine justitia est iniquitatis materia, quo enim validior eo promptiorest, ut inferiorem opprimat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. de Offic. c. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>35.</hi>
                     </note> that fortitude without justice is but the matter of iniquity, because the stronger it is, the more ready it is to oppresse infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors; so it may be said that fortitude without wisedome, is but the matter of folly; because the stronger it is the more apt it is by folly to run into mischiefe. But in this place I conceive to be understood ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an outward force and might, then which, a vertuous wisedome is by far better, and not seldome prevaileth over it. That which is said to <hi>Rebecca</hi> concerning the twins that were in her wombe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Genes.</hi> 25.23.</note> according to the Originall may be taken that the greater should serve the lesse, and Saint <hi>Austin</hi> taking it so,<note place="margin">Augustin.</note> affirmeth it to be true in the case of vertue. For though vertue appeare to be lesse, more vile, and despicable, at length it shall triumph over the most mighty, and subdue them under her command. How litle was <hi>David</hi> in power, when he fled from <hi>Hierusalem?</hi> How great was the might of <hi>Absalom?</hi> What therefore was it that made <hi>Cushi</hi> rather to joyne himselfe with <hi>David</hi> then with <hi>Absalom?</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, that having considered both sides in his mind, he found <hi>Davids</hi> side although litle yet to be stronger, because <hi>justice</hi> was with it. <hi>Absaloms</hi> side though great, yet to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker because it was unjust.<note place="margin">Chrysostm. in Psal. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> And that therefore standing, <hi>non ubi mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudo hominum, sed ubi virtutis praesidium, opem Dei ad se traxit,</hi> not where there was a multitude of men, but where was the defence of vertue, he drew unto himselfe the assistance of God. The admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Father is, that we would doe the same, and alwayes stand with them with whom standeth right, although they be never so many that doe withstand it. For as he concludeth, <hi>vitium etsi secum habeat
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:177008:169"/> universum orbem terrarum est omnium maxime imbecillum, virtus autem etsi sola sit est omnium potentissima,</hi> vice although it have the whole world with it, is of all things most weak; vertue though it be alone is of all things the strongest. <hi>Neverthelesse the poore mans wisedome is despised, and his words are not heard:</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reads it according to the Originall most directly thus, <hi>&amp; sapientia pauperis quae despecta est, &amp; verba ejus quae non sunt audita,</hi> and the wisedome of the poore man which is despised, and his words which are not heard. According to which reading the sense is; wisedome is better then strength, yea even the despised wisedome of the poore man, and his words which no man vouchsafeth to heare. The septuagint and the Vulgar Latin read it, <hi>Quomodo ergo sapientia pauperis contempta est, &amp; verba ejus non audita?</hi> How therefore is the wisedome of the poore man despised, and his words not heard? As making a wonder and a strang thing of it. The French translation readeth the latter part of the verse thus, <hi>The wisedome of the poore man is despised and there is nothing heard spoken of his deeds:</hi> which as the Hebrew admitteth, so it answereth to the conclusion of the former verse, where it is said, and no man remembred that same poore man. To consider our translation; it seemeth to me to of a poore Prophet or minister, for poverty is commonly the companion of such. And too often it is that his counsel is despised, although it be taken from Gods word, which is of such excellency, that as Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Homil. <hi>2.</hi> ad populum.</note>
                     <hi>Multis saepe unum verbum sufficit hinc excerpsisse ut totius vitae principium habeant,</hi> oftentimes it sufficeth to many to have taken one word from thence, that they might have a beginning for the ordering of their whole life. Too often it is, that his words are not heard? or if they be heard, it is only for the delight of them. Whereas Sainth <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Chrysost.

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> most directly according to the Originall readeth the verse thus, <hi>Verba sapientium inquiete audiuntur, plusquam clamor potestatem habentis in stultis, The words of the wise in quietnesse are heard rather, then the cry of one that hath power among fooles.</hi> And as for the meaning of them, I conceive the Preacher to go on still in shewing wisdome to be better then strength or power, and as before he shewed it in the deeds of wisdome, so here he shewes it in the words of wisdome. For he saith, <hi>that the words of wise men in quiet,</hi> that is beeing delivered in softnesse and quietnesse of voice, and comming from a quietnesse and meeknesse of Spirit, which is not disturbed either with pride or fury, yea though they proceed from them, who live in the privatenesse and quietnesse of a low and meane condition, yet are heard sooner, and being heard prevaile more, then <hi>in fooles words that are.</hi> uttered with a lowd crye of the voice, with a strong passion of fury in the heart, with a domineering insolency of speach, yea though they
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:177008:170"/> come from one, who for his place hath command and authority over them to whom he speaketh. The words of wise men are like the river <hi>Indus,</hi> of which <hi>Minutius Foelix</hi> speaking saith, <hi>Indus fluvius &amp; serere Orientem dicitur &amp; rigare,</hi> the river <hi>Judus</hi> is said both to sow the East and to water it; for so it may be said of the words of the wise that they are both <hi>semina &amp; flumina,</hi> both seeds and rivers, seeds because they sow goodnesse in their hearers;<note place="margin">Minutus Foelix in Octavio.</note> rivers because they water that which is sowen and make it to grow in them. But the cry of fools is like a violent torrent, which washeth away that which it soweth, and doth not suffer it to continue in the ground. <hi>Saint Gregory</hi> speaking of a perverse Preacher saith, <hi>fortitudo ejus est elata scientia locutionis, qua inflatus caeteros despicit, atque in contemptu omnium quasi singulariter apud se peritus intumescit,</hi> his strength is a lifted up knowledge of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,<note place="margin">Gregor. Moral. lib. <hi>17.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> by which being exalted he despiseth others, and swelleth in a contempt of all, as if in himself he were singularly learned. And what is <hi>the cry of fooles being in authority?</hi> What is the greatnesse and power of their words, but the same vain glorious pride, and which is despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the hearers, as much as they despise them to whom they speak? By application wee may consider the truth of this in the Preachers of the Church whereof some, like wise men, deliver their words in quietnesse, in the quietnesse of a well composed speach and mind, and graced with the quietnesse of a well ordered life. Now these are they whose words are heard, for what is their voice but as <hi>Gillebertus</hi> speaketh, <hi>vox Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi>

Of these <hi>Paulinus</hi> speaking saith, <hi>Ʋbique ancupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur verbum Dei, de omnium fidelium ore pendeamus, quia in omnem fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delem Spiritus Dei spirat, &amp; necesse est à minimo Dei servo velguttam caelestis sapientiae distillare, quae ariditatem mei cordis irroret, &amp; mihi supra omnium saeculi sapientum flumina, ad portum utilitatis exuberet,</hi> Let us seek every where after the word of God,<note place="margin">Paulin.

                     </note> let us hang upon the mouths of all his faithfull ministers, because the Spirit of God brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth on every one that is faithfull, and it cannot be but that from the least servant of God, some drop of heavenly wisdome should distill to bedew the drynesse of my heart and to abound unto me into the haven of my profit, above all the rivers of the wise men of the world. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there are,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc ver.</note> who as <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> speaketh, <hi>in clamore vocis suae &amp; populi acclamantis,</hi> in the cry of their owne voice, and of the people applauding them, doe please themselves, and are pleasing to the ears of others, but are not heard in their hearts, doe not work upon their consciences. For though their voice cry aloud, yet it is the cry of fooles, their lives being dumbe and themselves not practising that which they teach. Whereas <hi>Saint Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>habeat vita tua claram vocem, &amp; licet os tuum obstruxeris, vel tuba clarius personabis,</hi> let thy life have a cleare voice,<note place="margin">Chrysost. in Psal. <hi>49.</hi>

                     <hi>Saint Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>praedicator quisque plus actibus quam vocibus inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, &amp; bene vivendi vestigia sequentibus imprimat, ut potius agendo quam loquendo quo gradiatur offendat.</hi> Let every Preacher sound aloud rather by his actions then by his words,<note place="margin">Gregor.

                     </note> and by his well living let him imprint steps for others to follow him: So that he shew them rather by his living, then by his speaking, whither they must go. The Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint and the vulgar Latin read the verse thus, <hi>Verba Sapientium audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untur in silentio, plusquam clamor principis interstultos,</hi> the words of the wise are heard in silence, more then the crye of a <hi>Prince</hi> among fooles, where <hi>Lyra</hi> noteth, that it is said in the plurall number, the words of the wise or of wisemen, as shewing those words to be spoken of, <hi>quae procedentia ab ore sapientis proposita sunt sapientibus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> which comming frō the mouth of a wise man are delivered to wise hearers. For by them saith he they are heard in silence that is, <hi>attente,</hi> attentively and carefully. Or else their words are said to be heard <hi>in silence,</hi> because saith the <hi>Glosse, in silentio audientium,</hi> in the silence of the hearers, which is the same in effect. So that according to this reading the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Preacher is: that the words of wise men have more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over wise hearers then the proclamations of <hi>Princes</hi> have over fooles. Wherein is shewed as well the folly of not obeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of governours, as the power of wisdone in commanding wise hearers. And this seemeth to be the meaning of our translation.<note place="margin">Tremedus in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius</hi> read's the verse thus, <hi>verba Sapientium submissorum audienda esse potius quam clamorem dominantis cum stolidis suis,</hi> the words of wise submisse men are to be heard rather, then the crye of a foolish ruler, as he expoundeth himself. The <hi>French</hi> translation reads it thus, <hi>the words of the wise ought to be heard more quietly, or as the margent varyeth it, the words of the wise who keep themselves ought to be heard rather, then the crye of him that ruleth among fooles.</hi> The first reading suposeth the meaning to be, that the words of the wise ought to cause more attention, then the crye of him who for his crying beareth rule among fooles. The latter reading supposeth the meaning to be, that wise men, who keepe themselves quiet from tumult sedition and faction, are rather to be heard, then they, who by their factions and tumultuous crying and shrieking have great authority and power among fooles, whom they lead after them.</p>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. <hi>Wisdome is better then weapons of war:</hi> the Preacher here seemeth to mee to answere an objection. For though it would be granted, that wisdome in war is better then strength, in respect of fore seeing dangers, and in regard of providing against them, and of preventing of them, yet it might be questioned, whether, when it came to the push, when it came to the joying of the battle or combate, strength then were not more to be prefered. For though in the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and ordering of things wisdome might have the precedency, yet it might seeme that in the acting and executing of them strength should have the upper hand. To take away therefore this objection, the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:177008:171"/> Preacher saith <hi>that wisdome is better then the instruments of war,</hi> which serve for the acting and executing of it. And indeed the Originall word here used to signify war is <gap reason="foreign">

The vulgar Latin reads it as the Septuagint, <hi>Qui in uno peccaverit multa bona per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det;</hi> he that sinneth in one thing shall loose many good things: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which sense Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> also saith that the Hebrew may be rendred.

Wherefore the tenet of the schooles is, that there can be no vertue in man without wisdome, and hereupon it is that wisdome is most necessary in the life of man. <hi>Aquinas</hi> sheweth it thus, <hi>Bene vivere est bene operari,</hi> to live well saith he is to doe well: now that any one may doe well, it is not only required that he doe what he should, but that he doe it as he should, which is to doe it out of a good consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:177008:171"/> and not of passion only. The consideration then of choice is in those things, which do respect the end, and therefore the rightnesse of this consideration requireth two things. The first is a due end, the second is that which is conveniently ordered for the due end. Now to the due end man is fitly disposed by vertue, whose object is a good end: but for that whereby a man is rightly disposed towards the due end, this is done by the right ordering of reason, because to consider and to choose are the actions of reason.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.3.</note> for as he that had the spot of leprosie in any one part of his body was accounted a leper, although all the rest of his body were sound and whole; so he who hath the spot of the leprosy of sin in any one thing, therby is deprived of the society of the Saints and of Gods people, though otherwise he may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane. The same was also shewed by the sacrifices: for that which was to be sacrificed to God, was to be without any blemish; because the blemish of any one commandement broken, taketh away the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of all the rest that is done, and maketh it to be unpleasing to God, unprofitable to man.

For the Church of Rome being famous in the world and worthily glorious for those blessed lights of the Christian Church which anciently had been Bishops in it, to prevent the blemish, or at least to maintaine the credit of it against any occasion that might arise, this invention was set up, that a Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> by erring could not be blemished. Hence it is also that many learned men have defended their owne errours, and that their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers have justified their masters in them. For that a small folly might not diminish the greatnesse of their fame, they have laboured to make even folly to be wisdome. Whereas this it is indeed which hath been
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:177008:172"/> the dead fly that hath made the oyntment of their renowne to send forth a stinking Savour. For as saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>musca nimis insolens &amp; inquietum est animal: in qua quid aliud quam insolentes curae desideriorum carnalium designantur?</hi> A fly is a very insolent and troublesome creature,<note place="margin">Gregor. Moral. lib. <hi>18.</hi> cap. <hi>28:</hi>
                     </note> in which what else is signified then the insolent affections of carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Let a fly be driven away many times he still comes againe, and will not be kept away, he returneth to the oyntment untill he be drowned in it, and then makes it to give a stinking savour; even so it is with the affections of men, which although their understanding see them to be placed amisse, and doth as it were drive them away, yet they pressing upon them, untill they sink into them and fasten in them, doe then make the credit even of learned and famous men to be defiled and blemished. Wherefore the <hi>Chaldee</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chald.</note> expounding this verse saith, <hi>appetitus malus qui moratur ad portas cordis sicut musca, adducit mortem in saeculo, eo quod faetere facit sapientem in eo tempore quo peccat, &amp; disperdit nomen bonum, quod simile erat oleo unctionis, quod confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum est aromatibus,</hi> an evill lust,<note place="margin">Chald.</note> which abideth as it were at the gates of the heart like unto a fly, bringeth death in this world, because it maketh a wise man even to stinck in that time wherein he sinneth, and destroyeth his good name which was like unto the anoynting oyle that was made of spices. But why should any man be ashamed to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his errours, to confesse his imperfections, seeing there is no man without errours, without imperfections?<note place="margin">Hieronym. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Pelag. l. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> expoundeth the last part of this verse unto this sense, saying, <hi>muscae mortuae demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuntur atque corrumpunt suavitatem olei; quis mortalium aliquo errore non capitur?</hi> Dead flyes destroy and corrupt the sweetnesse of the oyle; what mortall man is there that is not taken with some errour?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Isa.</hi> 7.18.</note> And in his comment upon this verse saith, <hi>muscae quae secundum</hi> Isaiam <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantur in parte fluminis Aegypti perdunt olei suavitatem; in unoquoque credentium relinquentes immunditiae suae adorem &amp; vestigia,</hi> the flyes which according to the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> abound in some part of the river of <hi>Aegypt</hi> destroy the sweetnesse of the oyle leaving in every beleever the sent and footsteps of their uncleanesse. Another exposition which he giveth of the first part of this verse is this;<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>quod sic malus commmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus bonis contaminet plurimos, quomodo muscae si morantur in unguento perdant odorem illius &amp; saporem,</hi> that a wicked man mixed among good defileth many, even as flyes, if they dye in oyntment, destroy the sweetnesse and the savour of it. The last part of this verse Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> a greably also to the Hebrew readeth thus, <hi>pretiosa est super sapientiam &amp; gloriam stultitia parva,</hi> a little folly is more pretious then wisdome and glory; and he giveth it this meaning, that because oftentimes wisdome is joyned with craftinesse, and prudence hath naughtinesse in it, he exhorteth therefore that we seeke after simple wisdome, which is joyned with the innocency of doves: let us be wise to that, which is good, and simple to that which is evill. Or else the meaning may be expressed thus, that a simple and downe right wisdome being no way crafty and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:177008:173"/> vaine glorious, which generally in this world is accounted for foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is more pretious then wisedome and glory, that is then a vaine-glorious and ambitious wisedome, which is the wisedome of this world, being impatient of injuries under pretence of credit and honour, and given to ambition under a shew of vertue and of doing good. The Chaldee also reading this last part of this verse in the same manner, thus delivereth the sense of it, <hi>quam gloriosus &amp; decorus est magis quam sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia sapientium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chald.</note>
                     <hi>&amp; divitiae divitum, vir cujus insipientia est parva &amp; modica?</hi> how glorious and beautifull is that man above the wisedome of the wise, and the riches of the rich, whose folly is little and small? that is, as I conceive, the wisedome of the wise in this world, being indeed no wisedome, though in their owne apprehension it may seeme never so great; and the glory of the rich being indeed no glory though in their owne eyes it seeme very bright, and dazle the sight of others: it is he who knowing that he cannot attaine unto true wisedome laboreth to make his folly as little as he can, that excelleth them both. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> reading the first part of the verse as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth, <hi>muscae moriturae exterminant suavitatem olei,</hi> dying flyes drive away the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the oyntment, or which is indeed rather a mixture of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and of the vulgar Latin, by allusion he applyeth it unto the oyle of Christs blood,<note place="margin">Bernard. Serm.

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>A wise mans heart is at his right hand:</hi> that is, in him things are placed and ordered contrary to the course of depraved nature, he doth not make that, his guide to lead him in his wayes, he doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the courses of it; his wisedome sheweth the corruption of it. <hi>A fooles heart is at his left hand:</hi> that is, as nature inclineth him so is he carryed, he doth not strive against the corruption of it, that is his leader, after which he goes, and as a foole thinketh his way to be right because he followes that. Or els thus, <hi>a wise mans heart is as his right
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:177008:173"/> hand,</hi> and he doth that in his actions, which his heart thinketh, his works and his heart are neere together: <hi>but a fools heart is at his left hand,</hi> he thinketh this and that, but he doth it not, or if he doe it, it is with the left hand very untowardly. Or els thus, <hi>a wise mans heart is at his right hand,</hi> that is, carried rightly unto the right object of it; for though the heart be placed at the left hand, yet in respect of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which standeth as it were opposite and contrary unto it, it may be said to be at the right hand. But a fooles heart is at his left; the object at which he loooketh is not placed right before him, and he looketh as it were aside and awry in his desire, by which he is carried to it. To this purpose <hi>Lyra</hi> expoundeth it, who saith, <hi>the heart of the wise is at his right hand, quia dirigitur ad bonum moris per dextram designatum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is directed to that which is good in manners signified by the right hand: <hi>and the heart of a foole is at his left hand,</hi> because he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth always to evill, which is signified by the left hand. Or els thus, <hi>the heart of a wise man is at his right hand,</hi> that is, he worketh nothing but that which is right, his actions as they come from his heart, so they come from a right heart intending good by them, and they are done in a right manner, a right heart being carefull so to order them and to performe them. <hi>But a fooles heart is at his left hand,</hi> and though his action may be good in it self, his heart is not good from which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; or though his heart, his meaning may be good, yet that which he doth is spoiled and overthrowen in the handling and doing of it: or else his heart being naught, his hand, his works and actions are naught also. For according to the pattern in the heart, so is the work of the hand made. To this purpose doth <hi>Tremellius</hi> expound it, saying, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientem nihil nisi cogitate agere, &amp; cum animo suo prius expendere quàm dextram adopus admoveat,</hi> a wise man doth not doe any thing without premeditation, but first he considereth it in his mynd, before he putteth his hand unto any thing. But a foole is carried on without considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp; rationem &amp; sapientiam a se depellere,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tremell. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>ut quae aversantur homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fere sinistra depelluntur,</hi> and doth put away reason and wisedome from himselfe, as for the most part those things which men dislike are put away with the left hand. For so the manner is of fencers, who with the right hand assault there adversaries, and with the left hand defend themselves, and keepe off those things which would hurt them. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> expoundeth it that <hi>the heart of a wise man</hi> is said to be <hi>at his right hand,</hi> because he hath no left. For saith he <hi>justus sinistram non habet in se, sed totum in eo dextrum est,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.39.</note> a righteous man hath nothing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that is left; but all in him is the right. And to confirme this he alleadgeth the speach of our saviour in the Gospel who saith, <hi>resist not evill, but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also.</hi> Where Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> noteth, <hi>non jubemur sinistram genam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere percutienti, sed alteram dextram,</hi> we are not commanded to yeeld to him that smiteth the left cheek, but the other right cheek. Or els Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> expoundeth it, <hi>that a wise mans heart</hi> is said to be <hi>at his
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:177008:174"/> right hand</hi> &amp;c. because he that is wise doth alwayes think of the world to come,<note place="margin">Hieron. in hunc vers.</note> and which leadeth to the right hand, for there the sheep shall be placed: whereas <hi>the foole</hi> myndeth the present world, which is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>on the left hand</hi> for there the goats shall stand. To this purpose the Father alleadgeth the verse of the Poet, <hi>dextera, quae magni Duis sub maenia ducit, hac iter Elysium nobis: at laeva malorum exercet poenas &amp; ad impia tartara mittit,</hi> there is the right hand which leadeth under the wals of great <hi>Pluto,</hi> this way we goe to the <hi>Elysian</hi> feilds: but the left hand bringeth to the torments of the wicked, and sendeth them into cruell hell. But to make use of the Originall, which may be translated <hi>the right side</hi> as well as <hi>the right hand,</hi> then if we read it <hi>A wise mans heart is at his right side</hi> &amp;c, in respect that the side of a man is that whereon he resteth, we may give it this sense, that the heart of a wise man resteth on those things, which are at the right side that is on better things, in them taketh delight, in them placeth his confidence: but that the heart of a foole restest on those things, which are at the left side, that is, on worser things, upon them setteth his affections, in them placeth his affiance. Or lastly we may conceive that <hi>a wise mans heart is said to be at his right side,</hi> because it is joyned in affection to things that are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, to heavenly and spirituall things, but the heart of a foole is said to be at his left side, because it is joyned in affection to things of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, profit, honour and the earthly contentments of this life. But how few such wise men are there?<note place="margin">Hiero. ad Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triad. Vig. Ep. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> how many such fooles? Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> complaineth, <hi>In omnibus mundi studiis profectu non satiantur homines, in virtute tantum caepisse sufficiet ferventissimi in terrenis, frigdissimi in caelestibus sumus, &amp; summam in rebus parvis exhibemus alacritatem, ad majora torpescimus,</hi> in all the labours of the world men are never satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed with going on, in vertue it shall suffice to have begunne only: we are most fervent in earthly things, most cold in heavenly, and in the prosecution of small matters we shew great alacrity, but unto greater things, and things of importance we are quite dull. Saint <hi>Austin</hi> also complayneth of the same, saying, <hi>piger es ad faciendum ante te opus bonum, &amp; strenuus es ad transeundum mare: quia avaritia imperat, servis, quia Deus jubet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Augustin. in Psal. <hi>128.</hi>

The reason of it is, because <hi>the heart of men is not at their right side, as the heart of wise men is; but at their left side, as the heart of fooles is.</hi> For so Saint <hi>Austin</hi> telleth us <hi>vis desideriorum facit toleran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam laborum &amp; dolorum, &amp; nemo nisi pro eo quod delectat, sponte susci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit ferre quod cruciat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Augustin. l. de patientia.</note> it is the force of desires that breedeth a quiet suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of labours and paines, and no man doth willingly endure that, which tormenteth, unlesse it be for that which delighteth. But if we be such who have turned our heart to the right side, and are going on the way that leadeth to the right hand of glory, then as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:177008:174"/> saith, <hi>Pudeat nunc negligentius in vitam, quam prius in mortē ire, &amp; minori studio salutis acquirere quam perditionis augmentum, nam ut omnino simus in excusabiles in via vitae, quo citius eo facilius curritur, &amp; leve salvato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris onus quo crescit amplius eo portabilius est,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bern. Epist. <hi>341</hi>
                     </note> let us be ashamed to goe on more negligently towards life, then before we went on towards death, and with lesse care to seek the increase of salvation, then of perdition; for that we might be altogether in excusable in the way of life, the faster it is run, the more easely it is gone, and the light burden of our saviour by how much greater it grows, by so much it is carried the more lightly, and is the lesse troublesome. Thus the words being metaphoricall, they may be taken and expounded divers wayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. The fooles heart in the verse before is said to be at his left hand, either because it is not carryed unto the right object, or else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it proceedeth not from a right beginning of due consideration: and in both these respects it is, that <hi>when he walketh by the way, his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome faileth him.</hi> For first when he is carryed to the wrong objects of this world, to the honors, profits, pleasures thereof, either he doth not attaine them, and so <hi>his wisdome faileth him;</hi> or els if he doe attaine them, he doth not find that good, that contentment in them, which he proposed and promised to himself, <hi>and so his wisdome failing him</hi> he <hi>shewed himself to all to be a foole.</hi> Secondly when his heart doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the beginning of a due consideration, then also <hi>when he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by the way,</hi> when he is going on, <hi>his wisdome faileth him,</hi> he is not able to bring to an end that which he hath begunne, he is not able to performe that which he hath taken upon him, <hi>and so saith to every one that he is a foole.</hi> This is that folly which our Saviour speaketh of, saying, <hi>which of you intending to build a tower, sitteth not downe first,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.28, 29.</note>
                     <hi>and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it. Least happily, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to mock him saying, this man began to build, and was not able to make an end.</hi> Another way we may take the meaning of the verse thus: that a foole hath not so much wit, as to conceale his folly, and seeing he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not shew his understanding, to hide the want of it; but even <hi>when hee walketh by the way,</hi> when he is in publike, <hi>his wisedome faileth him,</hi> and doth not keep him company, <hi>and he saith to every one that he is a foole:</hi> He saith it, and speaks plainly, although he say nothing, by that which he doth. And though <hi>he sayes it to every one,</hi> yet to himselfe he sayes it not, but thinketh himselfe to be very wise, and much wiser then they are, who see him to be a foole. <hi>Tremellius</hi> expoundeth the verse thus,<note place="margin">Tremell. in hunc vers.</note> that <hi>walking by the way,</hi> he is said <hi>to say to every one that he is a foole, Quia ipso vultu, gressu, &amp; signis omnibus clamat stoliditatem suam,</hi> because by his very countenanc, gate, and all signes hee proclaimeth his stoliditie. But all these expositions referre <hi>He</hi> unto the foole himselfe, when wee read, <hi>and he saith to every one that he is a foole.</hi> Whereas according to the Originall, the word <hi>He</hi> may be referred also to every one. So doth Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> referre it, and therefore saith, that this is the meaning of
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:177008:175"/> it, <hi>Stultus ut ipse peccat, sperat omnes peccare similiter, atque ex suo ingenio universos judiea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> A foole, as he sinneth himselfe, so he hopeth that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe sinne likewise, and he judgeth of every one according to his owne disposition. And the father shewes us; that <hi>Symachus</hi> did so translate the verse, as that he made this to be the meaning plainly. Hee therefore reads the verse thus,<note place="margin">Aristot. Polit. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Sed &amp; in via stultus quum ambulat, ipse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipiens suspicatur de omnibus, quod stulti sunt;</hi> but also a foole when he walketh in the way, being himselfe unwise, thinketh of all others that they are fooles. For as the Philosopher saith, <hi>qualis quisque est, tales existimat alios,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. <hi>118.</hi> Conc. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> such as every one is, the same he thinketh others to be; the lascivious man, thinketh others to be lascivious, the covetous person, thinketh others to be couetous, the foole thinketh others to be fooles. According as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> also saith, <hi>hoc proclivius suspicatur homo in alio quod sentit in seipso,</hi> that doth a man readily suspect of another, which he findeth in himselfe:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.</note> When <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> were comming downe from the mountaine, and heard a noyse in the campe, <hi>Joshua</hi> said there is a noyse of warre, but <hi>Moses</hi> said, The noyse of them that sing do I heare. Here was great difference in their judgement: but the reason was, That <hi>Joshua</hi> being a warre-like man, and addicted to armes, hee therefore judgeth the noyse to be a noyse of warre; but <hi>Moses</hi> being a man of peace, and given to peace, he judgeth the noyse to be a noyse of peace,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Aug. in Psal.</hi> 118. <hi>Conc.</hi> 12.</note> each judgeth according to his owne disposition. To this purpose Saint <hi>Austin</hi> also alleadgeth that place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he saith, <hi>But they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise.</hi> As if the meaning were, That they thinking others to be as themselves, and so measuring themselves by them, and comparing themselves with them, did therein shew themselves to be fooles both in their judgement of themselves and others. Neither is this the manner of fooles only, but sometimes of wise men also. <hi>Joshua</hi> being himselfe a simple honest man; true in his words and deeds, hee thought the same of others, and so was deceived by the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi> When the brethren of <hi>Joseph,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Genes.</hi> 37.32.</note> having sold him to the <hi>Ishmaelites,</hi> brought his garment to their Father, stayned with the blood of a kid; although <hi>Jacob</hi> knew the great hatred which his brethren did beare him, yet he never suspected what they had done unto him: for being himselfe a vertuous godly man, he could not suppose that any such villany should be committed by them. But that any one may not suspect evill of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is the too common fashion of people, it is good to observe the rule which Saint <hi>Austin</hi> giveth,<note place="margin">Aug. in Psal. <hi>118.</hi> Conc. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> and that is, <hi>non videre quod latet, non invidere quod eminet,</hi> not to take upon us to see that which is hid, not to see that with an envious eye, which by the eminencie of it appeareth plainly. But as the word <hi>He</hi> in the last part of the verse is referred to every one, so <hi>Lyra</hi> giveth another meaning of it: when a foole, saith he, <hi>walketh by the way,</hi> that is in wickednesse and sinne, for that is his way, <hi>his wisedome faileth him,</hi> being therein, in truth, a very foole. <hi>He saith to every one,</hi> that goeth not in his way, that followeth not his courses,

Wee read of <hi>Jacob,</hi> how he went into another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when his brother was angry with him, which Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> setteth downe thus, <hi>Jacob fratri indignanti pie cessit,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; Rebecca id est patientiae instructus consilio abesse maluit &amp; peregrinari quam excitare fratris indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationem, &amp; tunc redire quum fratrem mitigatum putaret; Jacob</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously gave way unto his brother, being angry, and instructed by the counsell of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> that is of patience, had rather be absent, and in a strange country, then to provoke his brothers wrath, and then to returne when he thought his brother to be pacified. And surely it is wisedome in such a case not to stand to affront anger, but to goe aside a litle out of sight, or at leastwise by yeelding to give place unto it. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> reading the words as our translation hath them, and as they are read generally, <hi>ne relinquas locum tuum,</hi> leave not thy place, thereupon
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:177008:176"/> saith, <hi>Locus tuus patientia est, locus tuus sapientia est, locus tuus ratio est, locus tuus sedatio indignationis est,</hi>

                     </gap> which is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeelding in our translation, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tells us, that generally in Greek it was translated <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>curatio aut sanitas,</hi> curing or healing, and so indeed it signifieth most properly, himselfe also therefore doth so translate it. But he tells us that <hi>Symmachus</hi> did translate it, <hi>quia pudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia comprimit peccata multa,</hi> because modesty appeaseth many offences. The French translation reads it <hi>la douceur,</hi> meeknesse and mildnesse. But the word properly signifying healing or curing: I conceive that here it is used as importing a desire to make amends, a care to redresse what hath been ill taken, or ill done, an indeavour to recover the favour that is lost. And this is said <hi>to pacifie, or to make to cease great offences,</hi> both in respect of him who is angry, and in respect of him with whom he is angry,<note place="margin">Tremel. in hunc vers.</note> as <hi>Tremellius</hi> noteth. First in respect of the Ruler that is angry, because it stayeth his anger from running into the sinne of revenge, or some other the like, according as we read, that the wise carriage of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail</hi> stayed <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.18.</note> when he was highly angry with <hi>Nabal.</hi> Secondly in respect of him with whom he is angry, because it maketh his offences though great, to be pardoned, and freeth him from the hurt that hee feareth by them. But the ancient Fathers generally expound this verse in a spirituall sense. And the beginning of the verse being read thus by them, <hi>Si spiritus potestatem habentis,</hi> if the spirit of him that hath power, they understand this Spirit to be the devill, wherefore Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> saith, the Scripture here signifieth the Prince of this world, and the ruler of this darknesse, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.2.</note> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of him. If he therefore ascend into our heart, and that our mind have received the wound of an evill thought,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> wee must not willingly give place, but wee must fight against this evill thought, and strive to be freed from this sinne, so that the thought doe not proceed into action. And in another place, the same Father speaking of this verse, saith, <hi>Quasi in procinctu, &amp; acie stamus semper ad pugnam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieron. ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metr. Epist. <hi>8.</hi>

Qui quod locum nostrum humilitatem paenitentiae dixerit, verbis se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentibus ostendit dicens, quia curatio faciet cessare peccata maxima. Quid est enim humilitas lamenti, nisi medicina peccati?</hi> as if he plainly said, if thou perceivest the Spirit of the tempter to prevaile in somthing against
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:177008:176"/> thee, leave not the humility of repentance. For that he meaneth the humility of repentance to be our place, he sheweth by the following words saying, that healing maketh great sins to cease.<note place="margin">Gregor. Moral. l. b. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> For what else is the humility of lamenting, but the remedy of sinning? Wherefore in generall he saith, <hi>malorum locus est superbia, sicut est contra humilitas locus bonorum,</hi> the place of sinners and evill men is pride, as on the the contrary the place of penitents and good men is humility. <hi>Beda</hi> also having cited this verse addeth, <hi>quod est aperte dicere, si principis mundi id est diaboli tentatio tibi forte institerit, caveto solcitus, ne à bona operatione cui insudabas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Beda in cap. <hi>27.</hi> Proverbiorum.</note>
                     <hi>desistas</hi> if the temtation of the Prince of this world that is the devill shall presse upon thee, be diligently carefull that thou desist not from that good working wherein thou diddest painfully labour. <hi>Lyra</hi> saith that the verse may be understood of the devill, but himselfe applyeth it <hi>fomiti peccati,</hi> to the Originall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of humane nature, saying <hi>if the spirit,</hi> that is <hi>impulsus</hi> the strong inclination <hi>potestatem habentis, of that which hath power,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> that is of naturall corruption, which is sayd to have power, because many do obey it as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power over them, <hi>shall rise up against thee,</hi> by pressing thee to sin <hi>leave not thy place,</hi> leave not thy stedfastnesse in vertue, in which a man ought to remaine as in a firme place. The reason followes, <hi>because healing will make great sins to cease,</hi> for though by resisting naturall corruption it be not wholy taken away in this present life, yet by such a resistance the power of it is diminished, &amp; vertue both setled &amp; increased, which is said to be a kind of health to the soule, and therefore by consequence a curing from infirnity. And this <hi>maketh sinne to cease,</hi> into which our naturall corruption would carry us, unlesse there were this healing or curing. He that is the Author of the Commentary on the Epistle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epesians,</hi> which is found amongst Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> works, folowing the generall exposition of this verse, doth thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the meaning of it, <hi>Ille superbus &amp; temerarius vult ascendere, sed etiamsi te oppressum putaverit, &amp; se extulerit, ne tu dederis locum, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas enim diaboli non in temeritate illius atque jactantia, sed in tua est voluntate,</hi> he, that proud and bold spirit, will rise up against thee,<note place="margin">In c. <hi>6.</hi> Epist. Ephes.</note> but though he thinke thee to be overcome, and doe lift up himselfe, doe not thou give place, for the power of the devill is not in his boldnesse and bragging, but in thy will. Another exposition which I meete with of this verse is this, <hi>Si dominandi cupiditas animum tuum invase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, locum prioremne facile deserueris, qui enim compescit in hujusmodi cupiditatibus animum suum multa vitabit &amp; gravia peccata,</hi> if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of having power and ruling,<note place="margin">Chald. Paraphr.</note> that is the spirit of ambition shall assault thy mind, be not hasty in leaving thy former place and condition. For he that subdueth his mind in these desires shall shun many and great offences. For indeed they are many sins into which this desire carryeth men, and it is not an easy matter to overcome it, when it riseth up.<note place="margin">Ambros. lib. <hi>4.</hi> in Lucam.</note> Wherefore Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, oftentimes those, whom no vices lead aside, those whom lust cannot move, whom covetousnesse cannot

                     <hi>solum illum Deus divitem novit, qui sit dives aeternitati, qui non opum sed virtutum fructus recondat,</hi> it is he only that God acknowledgeth for a rich man, who is rich unto eternity, and who layeth up the reveneus of vertues not of wealth. But to give some reason why the Preacher in this place expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the worthy in wisedome and vertue by this name <hi>rich,</hi> I conceive it to be, as shewing that God did honour them, and esteeme of them, though in the world they were not honoured nor esteemed, and that he had advanced them in glorious riches, though in the world they did sit in low places.

Or els the Preacher useth here this word, as shewing, that although they did not receive from others honour and dignity, yet by their owne paines they had gotten to themselves wisdome and worth, and that although the other were kept from them; yet that this could not be taken from them. The French translation doth read this word rich, <hi>ceu qui out de quoi</hi> they that have wherewith: as if the meaning were that fooles are set in high places, in dignities and honours, who have not wherewith, and are not of ability either to order their places, or to order themselves in their places: whereas they who have wherewith, who have wisedome and knowledge, as well to honour high places and dignities by their well discharging of them, as they should be honoured in them, are left to continue in a low ranke, Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> speaking of the Knight Templers saith, <hi>persona inter eos non accipitur, defertur honor meliori,</hi>

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:177008:179"/> would it not be a strange thing to see some beast ruling a man with a bridle, and at his pleasure to turne him and guide him which way he would? Surely no lesse strange sight it is, to see <hi>servants</hi> as Princes <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on horses,</hi> and to see <hi>Princes as servants walking</hi> upon the earth. The meaning of the verse, Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> delivereth thus, <hi>Equi nomine digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas temporalis accipitur, &amp; quum omnis qui peccat, servus est pecati; servi in equis sunt,</hi>

                     <hi>quod hi qui servi sunt vitiorum atque peccati, sive tam humiles ut servi ab hominibus computentur, subita a diabolo digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate perflati vias publicas mannis terant, &amp; nobilis quisque vel prudens pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertate oppressus gradiatur itinere officioque servorum,</hi> that they who are servants to vices, and sinne, or else are so base, that by men they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of as servants, being blowne up by the devill, with some sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den dignity, doe weare out the streets, and high wayes with their nags, &amp; he that is noble or wise, oppressed with poverty, goeth along the way afoote, and waiteth as a servant. So that the difference not only is, that the one rideth, the other is afoot upon the earth; but also that the one sitteth at his ease, the other walketh with paine and labour. But though <hi>the foolish, the wicked be upon horses,</hi> they are servants still: and though <hi>the vertuous and the wise walke upon the earth,</hi> they are Princes still.

                     <hi>Joseph</hi> was sold into <hi>Aegypt</hi> for a servant; but how was he a servant, <hi>who did binde Princes at their pleasure, and did teach Senators wisedome?</hi> How was he a servant, who bought the whole land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and made all the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> servants unto <hi>Pharoah?</hi> Even when he was the servant of <hi>Potyphar,</hi> he disdained not <hi>obsequium seduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> the obedient readinesse of diligence, but he kept still the height of vertue, he preserved still the fredome of righteousnesse, the authority of innocencie. The selling of him could not take away this from him. Money is no prejudice unto this, which oftentimes hath bought masters unto them, who have been the disturbers of it: <hi>nihil tabulae auctionales,</hi> the deeds of bargaine and sale doe no wayes hinder this, by which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the buyer hath been condemned unto bondage.

He that is a foole, he that is wicked, though a Prince, is but a servant, he that is vertuous, he that is wise, though a servant, is a Prince. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> sheweth them both, who speaking of the first, saith, <hi>Stulto &amp; imperare servitus est, &amp; quod pejus est, quum paucioribus praesit, pluribus dominis &amp; gravioribus servit,</hi>

For he serveth his passions, he serveth his lusts, whose dominion over him he is not able to shun, neither night nor day: for he hath his masters with him, and within himself suffereth this unsufferable servitude. Of the other, he saith, he that wil be free, let him be a servant of the Lord, <hi>ea enim parte qua participamur servitute, participamur &amp; regno,</hi> for so far as we are intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in this service, so far we are interested in a kingdome: yea it is <hi>the Kingdome of heaven, which is within us,</hi> as our Saviour speaketh.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.21.</note> There is no little servitude in the Princes of the earth, even as they are Princes, and therefore <hi>Philo</hi> noteth, that it is well said of <hi>Joseph,</hi> that he was sold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> because he that ascendeth into a place of dignity, of a free man, is made a servant,<note place="margin">Philo de Joseph.</note>

The consideration of the former verses, wherein the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher speaketh of the advancement of the unworthy, the low estate of them that are worthy, induceth me to understand this verse of him, who that he may exalt his owne unworthines, <hi>diggeth a pit</hi> by plots and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and secret suggestions, whereby to keep others down, and of him whose ambitious desire, that he may get up on high, careth not <hi>to break down hedges,</hi> to leap over ditches, and where his owne worth findeth not a way open for him, to make a way by the force of importunitie, and other sinister courses. And commonly where this violent desire is, it is a signe of little worth that there is to be found.<note place="margin">Abusensis in <hi>2.</hi> Reg. c. <hi>15.</hi> v. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> For so <hi>Abulensis</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth his judgement, saying, <hi>Qui honorem desiderat, non est dignus hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, &amp; qui desiderat statum excellentem non potest eum convenienter susti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,</hi> hee that desireth honor, is not worthy of honor, he that desireth a high place, is not a man able fitly to discharge it. But to him that <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth this pit</hi> for others, the Preacher saith, that <hi>he shall fall into it:</hi> for many times himselfe falleth from the height of his ambitious hope, who seeketh to keep downe others from rising. The Princesse of <hi>Babylon</hi> had digged a pit for <hi>Daniel,</hi> as low as the Lyons den, that by his fall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves might be advanced in the Kings favour: but <hi>Daniel</hi> being preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it, and taken out of it, themselves were cast into it, and there were consumed, and perished. To him that <hi>breaketh so an hedge,</hi> the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher saith that <hi>a serpent shall bite him:</hi> and indeed, what is ambition it selfe,<note place="margin">Bernard. l. <hi>3.</hi> de considerat.</note> but a biting serpent? Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith of it, <hi>O ambitio ambienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um! crux quomodo omnes torquens omnibus places? nihil acrius cruciat, nihil molestius inquietat, nihil tamen apud miseros mortales celebrius negotiis ejus:</hi> O the ambition of the ambitious!

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:177008:180"/> unto themselves divinity, and lost their felicity. They break through <hi>the hedge</hi> of Gods commandement, to come to the forbidden tree, and how grievously, how deadly did <hi>the serpent bite them?</hi> And surely oftentimes when ambitious heads <hi>breake through hedges,</hi> to get to high places, there <hi>is a serpent</hi> lurking secretly, which bites them by the heele, and either stops them from going on, or else bringeth by it some great mischiefe upon them. Or else <hi>the serpent</hi> that biteth these ambitious subtile wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, is some other more subtile then they, by whom they are undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their plots.

                     <hi>audet perficere quod Deus novo supplicio cogatur vindicare,</hi> ambition teacheth that which nature knoweth not, which naturall affection abhorreth, and dareth to enterprise that, which God is compelled to punish with a strange and new judgement. Or else if <hi>the serpent bite</hi> not so hard, it is not seldome seen, that when the tree is ready to beare, it biteth off the bud, and when ambition seeketh for the fruit of a long sought-for greatnesse, it findeth none in it. When the Lord saith unto the Prophet <hi>Zachary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

And plainly it is so with many in the folly of ambition, they have broken through <hi>a hedge</hi> to come to greatnesse, and thereby have broken the bagge of their greatnesse, that it affordeth small benefit unto them: they haue leapt over a wall to get into honour, but the leap hath broken their staffe, so that they have little comfort to support them. <hi>A serpent</hi> hath bitten them, and the poyson thereof cannot be gotten out. Another exposition which <hi>Lyra</hi> giveth of this verse,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> is to understand here the hurt that commeth by the occasion of sinne, so that he that doth not shun the occasion of it, doth even fall into it, and he that being bold, doth runne into the occasion of sinne, doth even <hi>dig a pit,</hi> in which he is taken. To the same purpose he expoundeth the latter part of the verse, understanding <hi>the hedge</hi> to be the restraint of discipline and government, which whosoever breaketh,<note place="margin">Ephes. <hi>4.27.</hi> Anselm.

                     <pb n="368" facs="tcp:177008:181"/> considering the words of Saint <hi>Paul, Give no place to the devill,</hi> thereupon saith, that if the dore be not shut, or being shut, if it be not shut carefully, the devill, who is alwayes at the dore, will find some way of entrance into it. And he further tells us, that this dore hath two leafes, desire and feare, so that if we open either leafe, whether it be a desire after some worldly thing, or a feare of some earthly thing, the devill is ready to get in; and that therefore to be safe, wee must keepe both fast shut against him.

In like manner therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they who are Gods children, are vessells of mercy, belonging to his Sanctuary, it must be their care, while they are in the way of this life, that they be covered all over with a diligent watchfulnesse, because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the dust of sinne, or the pollution of some uncleanesse will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily fasten upon them.

But why not these small things, in which there could be no danger of drunkennesse? Surely least by the contentment of these, he might be drawne to desire the wine, and so be carryed on to sinne.

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. The Preacher joyning this verse unto the former, I shall consider it in the same manner; and first to speak of the unworthy, ambitiously seeking to be on high, and placed in greatnesse; here the Preacher sheweth, that as he who taketh upon him to remove a stone, which is too heavy for him, shall be hurt with it; so he that taketh upon himself some weighty place of dignity, which he is not able to discharge shall be oppressed by it. As he that heweth wood which is too hard for him, is much endangered by it; so he that putteth himself into a place of greatnes which is too hard for him to performe, putteth himself into great danger also.<note place="margin">Seneca Epist. <hi>14.</hi>

                     </note> And su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely if wise men who sit in a low place are not free from troubles and dangers, then certainly fooles being in great dignity cannot but be distressed by them. But it is the nature of ambition, not to regard dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and therefore <hi>Saint Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>paratos ambitiosos videas uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versa pericula subire, scandala suscitare, sustinere odia, opprobria dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulare, negligere maledicta,</hi> thou mayest see ambitious persons ready to undergo all dangers, to raise up scandals, to sustaine hatreds, to dissemble reproaches, to neglect cursings. And surely being so ready to undergo them, no mervaile if they fal into them, no mervaile if they perish by them. Secondly to understand the verse as speaking of the occasions of sin: the Preacher in the verse before having spoken of occasions generally, and of lesser occasions, here he speaketh of great occasions, shewing, that as he who thinketh to remove great stones lying in his way, shall hurt himself and not be able to doe it, so he that thinketh to go on in a right course, and thrusteth himself upon strong occasions of beeing misled, presuming not to be hurt by them, shall find himself to be deceived, when his hurt will be manifest. For as <hi>Saint Bernard</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Bernard. in Cant. Serm. <hi>65.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>majus est miraculum inter vehementes occasiones non cadere, quam mortuos suscitare,</hi> it is a greater miracle not to fall being among strong occasions, then it is to raise up the dead. And as he who thinketh to make his axe go thorow very hard wood, is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not a little endangered by the rebound which is given to it, so he who thinketh to make the edge of his care, to passe thorow strong occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of sinning to which he applyes himself, shall find his great care to be not a little endangered. The Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> hath a true saying,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ecclesiast.</hi> 3.26.</note> he that loveth danger shall perish therein: he that will not decline danger shall not be able to decline destruction by it. And therefore indeed what doth he but even love his owne perishing, that loveth to be in danger? What doth he but shew a willingnesse to sin, who is willing to run into strong occasions of it? If wee take the verse by it self, it may admit this sense and meaning of it: that seeing the removing of stones, which is so poore a thing hath labour and trouble and paine with it, for so the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. <hi>Saint Gregory</hi> writing upon a passage of <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>Per fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum virtus, per aes autem perseverantia exprimitur. Per ferrum homo enim: mala adversantia penetrat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregor. Moral. c. <hi>34.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>per aes bona quae proposuit longanimiter servat. Aes enim rubigine nulla consumitur,</hi> by iron vertue, by brasse perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is expressed. For by iron a man breaketh thorow evils that doe oppose him, by brasse he preserveth long the good things
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:177008:182"/> which himself hath proposed: for brasse is consumed almost by no rust. By iron therefore here we may conceive to be meant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the vertue of the mind, for that it is which peirceth into things. And the meaning, which our translation yeildeth from the words, is this, that if the understanding be <hi>blunt</hi> and dull, and that <hi>the edge of it be not whetted</hi> with knowledge and learning, that then a man <hi>must put to more strength,</hi> must use the more paines and industry. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed great is the benefit, great is the help of a painfull industry. <hi>Saint Bernard</hi> speaking of it saith, <hi>Ʋt quid dormiet industria? Grande profecto in vobis donum naturae ipsa est,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernardus super Cant. Serm. <hi>84.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>quae si minus suas exequatur par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, nonne quod reliquum habet natura in vobis totum turbabitur?</hi> Why should industry be suffered to sleep? Truly even that is a great gift of nature in you, which if it be wanting to performe its part, is not all the rest which nature hath in you disordered and troubled? which if other things be wanting in it, doth make a good supply for them. <hi>But wisdome is profitable to direct:</hi> that is whether <hi>the iron be blunt or sharp.</hi> whether <hi>the edge be whetted or not whetted, whether more strength be put to, or not put to,</hi> whether sharpening, whetting, adding of more strength be needfull or not needfull wisdome serveth to direct in all. But the direct speaking of the Originall is this, <hi>If the iron be blunt, and he doe not whet the edge, and he put to more strength, but the benefit of rectifying is wisdome.</hi> Now to consider the verse with reference to the former, it seemeth to mee to give a reason, why he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. For if the iron which he useth be blunt, and he doe not amend it by whetting, but thinketh by the greater strength to make it to enter, he may easily not onely loose his labour, but get some hurt by it. And then to apply it also to ambition, and to the occasion of sinning, as I have done the verses before, first <hi>the bluntnesse of the iron</hi> signifieth the unworthinesse of him that seeketh or enjoyeth greatnesse,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Contic.</hi> 1.6.</note>
                     <hi>the not whetting of the edge</hi> signifieth want of care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make himself worthy, <hi>the putting to more more strength</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the violence and boldnesse, that notwithstanding is used in thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting into it, and in possessing of it. And this it is which doth the hurt. In the <hi>Canticles</hi> the spouse complaineth <hi>my mothers children are angry with mee,</hi> the vulgar Latin reads it <hi>pugnaverunt contra me, they have fought against mee, they made mee keeper of the vineyards, but myne owne vineyard have I not kept.</hi> Why was this a signe of anger or displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? was this any matter of hurt unto her, that shee was advanced to be keeper of the vineyards? Yes this it was, seeing thereby shee had not kept her owne vineyard. And surely not little is the hurt, which many receive by an unworthy greatnesse. Not seldome is it that they loose their credit, their good name, when they have gotten that,<note place="margin">Plutarch. l. de doctr. principum</note> if they get not worse hurt. He that having made a little statue, doth set it upon a great base, thereby maketh the littlenesse of it, the more to appeare, and when unworthinesse is set on high, then it is the more fully discovered. If the vessell be empty thou canst not tell whether it
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:177008:183"/> be found, but fill it with liquour, and it will so be seen. Many times the unworthinesse of men is not found while they are in low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but let them be advanced then it shew's it self, then it flyes out into some shame or other. Wherefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith well, <hi>non in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendis sed in utendis magnitudo sita est,</hi> that it is not in having but in using, that greatnesse consisteth. <hi>But the benefit of rectifying is wisdome,</hi> either wisdome in him that is unworthy to consider his unworthinesse, and so not to seek for that for which he is not fit, or else in him that perceiveth the unworthinesse, and so doth not bring him to it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to apply the verse unto occasion of sinning. <hi>The bluntnesse of the iron</hi> is a dull carelesnesse in the wayes of a mans life, <hi>the not whetting of the edge</hi> is a want of admonition which should quicken the carelesnesse, <hi>the putting to of more strength</hi> is the adding of force to the occasion, which thereby indeed is made the stronger, and doth both the sooner and the more dangerously pull into mischiefe. <hi>But the benefit of rectifying is wisdome.</hi> Wisdome to see how the hurt is increased, wisdome to see how the occasion is strengthned, wisdome to see the fault of the dull carelesnesse. Or else wee may understand the verse as shewing severall remedies, how a defect may be supplyed and succoured. As first <hi>if the iron be blunt,</hi> one way to help it, is <hi>to whet the edge of it,</hi> and to redresse what is amisse. Or if that be not done, another way of helping, <hi>is to put to more strength,</hi> and so to make use of some other thing which may be insteed of it. But for a generall help, there is none like <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> That is an help upon all occasions, that findeth help many wayes, and alwayes doth it in the best manner. <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the verse thus, <hi>Si retusum fuerit ferrum, &amp; hoc non ut prius; sed conturbatum fuerit, virtutibus corroborabitur, &amp; reliquum fortitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis sapientia est,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym in. hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>if the iron be blunted, and it be not as it was before, but that it be troubled, it shall be strengthned by vertues, and the remainder of strength is wisdome.</hi> And the meaning, which he giveth of it is; if any one doe see that by negligence he hath lost the knowledge of the Scriptures, so that beeing dull, he continueth not to be as he began. For oftentimes it commeth to passe, that when some one hath gotten a smack of knowledge, being lifted up by pride, he leaveth off to learne, and so by little, because nothing is added there grows a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, and the mind remaineth void of knowledge, <hi>the iron is dulled,</hi> for sloth and idlenesse are as it were a rust of wisdome. If it be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so with any one let him not be out of heart, let him go to his teacher, and let him againe be instructed by him, and after labour and industry and much sweate, for this it is, which in the Hebrew is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered significantly, <hi>fortitudinibus corroborabitur, by forces he shall be strengthned,</hi> that is by labour and industry and sweat and dayly reading, he shall obtaine wisdome and his strength shall have this end that he shall get wisdome. The Septuagint and the Vulgar Latin read the verse thus, <hi>Si retusum fuerit ferrum, &amp; hoc non ut prius, sed hebetatum fuerit, multo labore exacuetur, &amp; post industriam sequitur sapientia, if
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:177008:183"/> the iron be blunted, so that it be not as it was, but that it be dulled, by much labour it may be sharpned,</hi> and after industry followeth wisdome. And the meaning which <hi>Lyra</hi> giveth it is this, that the Preacher remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a false persuasion which men have, who think that it is an easy matter to returne from wickednesse to vertue,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> and therefore care not to seek after the occasions of sinning. But this the Preacher sheweth not to be so by the example of iron which is sharp. For if it smite upon a sharp stone the edge of it is lost, neither is it recovered but with much whetting. And so it is with him that declineth unto sin, for it is not easy for him, but a great difficulty to return into the right way, as experience confirmeth, and the Philosopher sheweth to be true. Or else as the Preacher before shewed the hurt of crafty deceit, so we may conceive him here to shew the hurt of open violence, and force.<note place="margin">Aristot. <hi>1.</hi> Ethit.</note> For when craft cannot prevaile, the way of many is to seeke their ends by strength of violence wherein themselves often times doe receive the mischiefe of it. Wisdome therefore it is which the Preacher prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth before both.</p>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. There are two or three words in the Hebrew, which doe cause this verse to be diversly rendred, the one is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> and the Vulgar Latine render <hi>in silentio</hi> in silence; the Septuagint render <hi>non in sibilo,</hi> not in a hissing, or not in a noyse which the Serpent
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:177008:184"/> makes. And these two readings in effect are the same. Our translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the French, and <hi>Tremellius</hi> do read it, <hi>without enchantment,</hi> for that also the Hebrew word doth signifie. The other words are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which S <hi>Hierome</hi> rendreth <hi>habens linguam,</hi> he that hath a tongue, <hi>Tremellius, tenens verba ejus,</hi> holding his words, and understandeth it of the enchanter, holding the biting of the serpent. So that his meaning maketh his reading to be the same with the Septuagint, who render it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantans,</hi> he that enchanteth. The french saith <hi>le languard,</hi> a long-tongued prating companion, and as our English hath it, a babler, wherein they differ not in meaning from the Vulgar Latin. For the sense is, that as the serpent will bite without enchantment, so a babler, a a fellow of many words, if he be not looked unto, is commonly a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and being no better then a serpent, will by his detraction, even bite also. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> applyeth his reading both to the sense of the Vulgar Latine, and to the sense of the Septuagint. As he applieth his reading to the sense of the Vulgar Latine,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> he thus expoundeth it, <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens &amp; detractor sunt aequales: quomodo enim ille secretò mordens venenum inserit, sic ille clam detrahens, virus pectoris sui infundit in fratrem,</hi> a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and a slanderer are equall: for as the serpent secretly getteth in his poyson; so he detracting closely, infuseth the venome of his brest into his brother. But further we may note, the likenesse between a slanderer and a serpent, in divers things. First, as all doe hate a serpent, and flie from the sight of it, so all doe hate a slanderer, and flie from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Secondly, a serpent, as S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, carrieth his poyson in his mouth, ready to be cast out, and with one biting poysoneth the whole body; so the slanderer hath his poyson in his mouth, ready to be vented, and with one word, as it were, with one biting, doth easily wound the name, credit, soule, the life of his brother. Thirdly as there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature to which the devill is likened so much as a serpent, for though he be called a Lyon, a Wolfe, a Fox, yet most commonly he is called the old Serpent; so there is no other sinner so like the devill, as a slanderer is, he being as the devill is an accuser of his brethren. Lastly as a Serpent feedeth upon nothing but upon the earth, so that if a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridg be set before him, he careth not for it; in the like manner a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer feedeth upon the hurt of others, as for that which is good in them he speaketh not of it. As S. <hi>Hierome</hi> applyeth his reading to the sense of the Septuagint he expoundeth it thus, if the Serpent the devill bite any one secretly and destroy him with the poyson of sinne, no other knowing of it; if he that is bitten hold his peace and do not betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto repentance, neither is willing to confesse his wound unto his brother and teacher; his teacher who hath a toung for the curing of it cannot easily be profitable unto him.<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>

The Preacher sheweth, saith he, the biting of a silent Serpent to be pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that is, if the suggestion of the devill and his temptation be not made knowne unto some enchanter, unto some spirituall person, who by the charms of the Sriptures useth for to heale the wound, and to draw out from the heart the poison of the Serpent, he will not be able to bring succour to him that is endangered and ready to perish. In the same kind <hi>Olympiodorus</hi> expoundeth the verse,<note place="margin">Olympiodor. in hunc vers.</note> if saith he the Serpent of sinne doe bite in silence, that is, so that the sinner will not confesse his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed, he that by holy enchantment hath taken upon him to be his helper, cannot be able to give any health unto him, untill he shall be willing to confesse his sinnes. And lastly unto this agreeth <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorius Neocaesariensis,</hi> who thus openeth the meaning of the verse,<note place="margin">Gregor. Neocaes. in sua Metaphr.</note> the hidden bitings of the Serpent the enchanters are not able to cure. For the hidden biting of the Serpent is sinne concealed by a sinner, which biting cannot be cured by the enchanters though never so wise, that is, by spirituall men and ministers, untill by confession it come to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested. <hi>Tremellius</hi> readeth the verse thus, <hi>Si momorderit serpens non adhibita incantatione, tum nullum est emolumentum incantationis te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenti verba ejus,</hi>

Perhaps this sigh at this time was like that groane, which our saviour gave when he raised up Lazarus from the dead. And as there some give the reason of his groaning, because he was to call back <hi>Lazarus</hi> into this miserable life, wherein he was to under goe many dangers; so here our saviour sighed, because he was to restore speaking to the dumbe, and hearing to the deafe by which he should be subject to many evils and dangers, seeing that the toung is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing, so that many have perished by it, and as the Preacher here speaketh <hi>the lips of a foole will swallow him up.</hi> But Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> doth not understand the mischiefe here spoken of to be referred to the foole himselfe: he reading the last part of the verse thus, <hi>Labia insipientis praecipitabunt eum,</hi> the lips of a foole will overthrow him, referreth the word <hi>him</hi> unto the wise man spoken of in the first part of the verse, saying, <hi>stultitia si sua esset rusticitate contenta minus aliquid haberet mali,</hi> if folly would be contented with its owne rudenesse it would have the lesse evill: but now it maketh war against wisedome, and whatsoever wisedome it seeth in a learned man, being provoked by envy it doth not approove it. For a wise man speaketh the words of knowledge,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> the words of grace, which are able to bring profit to the hearers, but the ears of a foole doe not so receive the things that are said as they are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but on the contrary endeavoureth to supplant a wise man, and to make him like unto himselfe. <hi>Et revera praecipitatur sapiens quando in aurem loquitur imprudentis, &amp; verba ejus in profundo ut ita dicam gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite pereunt,</hi> and indeed a wise man is as it were tumbled downe, when he speaketh in the eare of a foole, and his words doe perish, as I may so say, in a deepe gulf.

The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase seemeth to referre the word <hi>him</hi> neither to the foole himselfe, nor to the wise man spoken of in the first part of the verse but unto man generally, which thus expresseth the sense of the last part of the verse, <hi>labia hominis stulti increpationem invehunt atque adeo universo orbi interitum,</hi> the lips of a foolish man bring on threatnings, and so destruction to the whole world, as if the meaning were, that as the grace which is in the words of a wise mans mouth brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth good to many, and preserveth the world by the common benefit of it, even so the lips of a foole bring mischiefe unto many, and as it were by a generall infection doe cause the destruction of the world.

Not only when he began his journy, but when he ended it, did he find the favour and blessing of God upon him. He was the same in his care to serve to God, and the same was the goodnesse of God towards him. But here we have <hi>a foole beginning</hi> his journy, and he begins it with folly; here we have him <hi>ending</hi> his journy, and he ends it in mischievous mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The same that he was at first, the same he is at last, save only that his going on makes him to be worse. And surely it is most need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to take heed of the beginning of wickednesse and folly. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a beginning leads on farther, and that which is once began is not fortwith ended. Most safe it is to deny entrance unto folly, but if it be entred, thrust it out quickly. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had endured many plagues and were still hardened, but when they saw their first born to be slain, then they gave the <hi>Israelites</hi> leave to depart.

                     <note place="margin">Nicetas.</note> in <hi>Nazianzene</hi> meditating saith, as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> could not endure that plague but then permitted the <hi>Israelites</hi> to be gone, <hi>eodem modo dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monibus quoque animarum nostrarum persecutoribus gravissima haec paena videtur, quando in animo primogenita peccati, hoc est prima vitii origo, &amp; principium extinguitur;</hi> in like manner unto the devils who are the persecutours of our soules this punishment seemeth to be most grievous, when in the mynd the first born of sin, that is the first entring of vice, and the beginning of it is extinguished. But it is not the care of a foole to doe this, his foolishnesse begins assoon as the words of his mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,<note place="margin">Ambros. in Psal. <hi>119.</hi> Octon. <hi>17.</hi>

Plainely it is so with a foole, the very opening of his mouth to speak, openeth the way at which his folly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth. It is not said that the beginning of the words of his mouth is the beginning of foolishnesse, but in the beginning of his words he shews himselfe an absolute foole, and although then he should leave off
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:177008:187"/> to speak, he hath said enough to speak out his folly. But he goes on and <hi>the end of his talke is mischievous madnesse.</hi> To begin to speak foolishly may be the fault of a wise man, but he when he sees it, or hath it shewed unto him, he will not persist in it, or if he have spoken foolishly once, he will lay his hand upon his mouth, and will not doe so againe. But a foole having began to speak foolishly, he goes on in the same pace to the end, having once spoken like a foole, he will speak so againe and againe. The Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> saying <hi>Ephraim is an heifer, that is taught and loveth to tread out the corn,</hi> Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> considering the words, saith, <hi>vitula triturae laboribus assueta relaxata plaerumque ad eundem laboris usum etiam non compulsa revertitur,</hi>

                     </note> there is therefore true madnesse, and perhaps such was that of the Prophets, who prophesied in an extasy of mynd being filled with the spirit of God; so that they might seeme to some to be mad, when unmyndfull of their owne health, they did run naked oftentimes among the people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shod, as the holy Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> did. But though the Hebrew in that place of the Psalmes be not so, yet in this verse here the Hebrew is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>insania mala</hi> and evill madnesse, and so may seeme to inferre a good madnesse, perhaps such as that was in the ancient Prophets which

The meaning which I apprehend is this. <hi>A foole is full of words,</hi> as if he were full of matter, and multiplyeth still his words, as if he wanted words to expresse that which the abundance of his knowledge hath to say: notwithstanding a man that heareth him, <hi>cannot tell</hi> what it is at which he aymeth, what it is that he would have, to what his words will come, cannot tell what to make of them. <hi>And that which shall be after him,</hi> that which shall be said when he hath done, either to answere his words, or to reforme his errours, or to instruct himselfe, who can declare unto him? who can teach and <hi>tell him?</hi> For being possessed with a strong persuasion of his owne knowledge, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that to be as great as his words have been many, he disdaineth that any should be able to correct him. Or else the meaning may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thus. <hi>A foole is so full of words</hi> as if he knew all things, and could tell any thing; but a wise man cannot tell what shall be, much lesse a foole: there is none that can doe it, <hi>and what shall be after him, who can tell?</hi>

Or thirdly we may take the verse in this meaning. The Preacher having shewed in the end of the verse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the end of a fooles talking to be mischievous madnesse, here he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the reason of it: for as <hi>Lyra</hi> also speaketh, <hi>qui multiplicat verba fatua finaliter venit ad verba pessima,</hi> he that multiplyeth foolish words, in the end commeth to very naughty words.

                     <note place="margin">Aristoteles.</note> every evill body is ignorant, therefore he addeth that a man knoweth not, that is, such a foolish man knoweth not, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth not, doth not forecast, what is likely to ensue, what may follow though it be not likely: neither will he heare or regard any one that shall endeavour <hi>to tell him</hi> and to let him see it.

                     <hi>quid quod erit,</hi> a man knoweth not what that which shall be, and <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> taking the future tense there to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify the time past reads the verse thus, <hi>Et stultus verba multiplicat; Ignorat homo quid sit, quod factum est, &amp; quod futurum est post eum, quis annunciabit ei? A foole also multiplieth words. Man knoweth not what that is which hath been, and that which shall be after him, who shall
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:177008:188"/> declare unto him?</hi> And the meaning which he giveth of the verse is this: <hi>quum stulius nec praeteritorum meminerit, nec futura agnoscat, &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiae tenebris volutetur, falsam sibi scientiam repromittens, in eo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum se putat &amp; sapientem, si verba multiplicat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> when a foole neither remembreth the things that are past, nor knoweth the things that are to come, but tumbleth and stumbleth in the darknesse of ignorance, yet doth he promise himselfe a false knowledge, and therein thinketh himself to be learned and wise, because he multiplyeth words. The Septuagint also and the vulgar Latin read it, <hi>ignorat homo quod ante se fuerit,</hi> man knoweth not that which hath been before him, as if a foole were noted in that he neglected to consider the sayings and doings of wise men that had gone before him, and which are good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for man in his wayes. Another-meaning of the verse, which I meete with is this, that he who knoweth much and is able fully and elegantly to expresse himself yet hereby is not freed from the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a foole: it is not all his wisdome, all his eloquence that is able to take this off from him. For this one thing that he knoweth not what shall be, and that none can tell him, what shall be after him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him to be a foole still. To this purpose, <hi>Thuanus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Thuanus.</note> speaketh very well, <hi>Stultus voces usque deque effutit inanes, atque audire licet talia, blaterantem, laeti vivamus, quando humanum caligo futuri damnat ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> A foole talketh of this thing and that thing, and many wayes turneth his idle discourse, and one may heare him babling such like things as these, let us live merrily, seeing that an ignorance of that which is to come blindeth the knowledge of man, and shutteth his eyes that he cannot see it. But indeed seeing a darknesse in respect of that which shall be, oppresseth man, how should he lead a merry life? How can he freely enjoy his pleasures? Suppose him to be in honour, how can he rejoice in his obtained dignity, not knowing whether in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour there doe not lye hid his future disgrace, and in his pleasure his torment? There is no present good, which the ignorance of what is to come doth not destroy. <hi>Samuel</hi> telleth <hi>Saul,</hi>

Wherefore could a wise man tell what was to be, he might safely be merry in that which he had: but no man knowing this, he is but a foole that is transported with the present joy of any earthly thing. This igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is the misery of man, and this misery maketh the wisest man a foole. <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> writing to <hi>Eustochium</hi> telleth her, the troubles of marriage, and the uncertainties of wedlock thou hast learned by a domestick example; when thy sister <hi>Blesilla aetate major,</hi>

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:177008:190"/> speaking to the Land saith, <hi>woe to thee o Land,</hi> as condoling with it, and groaning together with it, under the burden of the misery.

The meaning therefore of the Preacher in this acception of the word is, that ordinarily the Child-hood of a King is the maturity of misery to his Kingdome, though extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily by the goodnesse of God it may be otherwise. Secondly if we understand a Child in wisdome, so he may be that is ancient in yeers, and being so, he cannot but be <hi>a woe to to his Kingdome.</hi> The want of wisdome in a Child by age is often supplyed, by the wisdome of his counsellers: the want of this in a man hath commonly a wilfulnesse joyned with it that will not be supplyed. The hand of a little Child may hold the stern of a great ship, when a greater strength may guide it.

Or else the words may be taken as speaking of such Princes as are greedy of prey, and like ravenous wolfs devoure in the morning: as often it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, where the King is a Child. But most directly the words seeme to speech of those, who make their owne benefit, for that the word <hi>eating</hi> noteth, to be the chiefe thing that they look after, and in their waies doe preferre that before the publicke good.

And as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is the Prince of this world, so by the Princes which feed in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he understandeth them, who feed on the delights of this world and nourish themselves in them. Wherefore he saith also, <hi>Woe to the Land, quae judices &amp; principes eos habet, qui amant hujus seculi voluptates,</hi> which hath those for judges and Princes, who love the pleasures of this world, who before the day of death commeth, say, let us eate and drinke for to morrow we shall dye. So doth Saint <hi>Austin</hi> also expound the last part of the verse, saying, <hi>Principes mane manducantes, idest, ante horam congruam, quia non expectant opportunam quae in futuro est faelicitatem, festinanter beari hujus saeculi faelicitate cupientes,</hi>

They therefore doe eate in the morning who are lifted up with the prosperity of this world, and while they earnestly seek after present things, they doe not think of those which are to come.

                     <hi>the creature doth groane under the captivity of this world,</hi> then as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh, <hi>ne tu deterior creatura efficiare, nec tu praesentibus rebus acquiescas, non enim illas solum non amplecti oportet, sed ingemiscere ob retardationum nostrae ab hoc orbe profectionis,</hi> be not thou made worse then the creature,<note place="margin">Chrysost. ibi.</note> neither doe thou set up thy rest upon things present.

For as <hi>Aquinas</hi> noteth out of <hi>Aristotle, De vili loco assumpti ad principatum, ut pluries laedunt politiam, &amp; laeserunt aliquando Calcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam, juxta illud poetae asperius nihil est humile quum surgit in altum,</hi>

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:177008:192"/> to that of the Poet, there is nothing more sharp and hard then a base person lifted up on high. In respect of a King, it is true which <hi>Chrysolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> hath, <hi>Major est innata gloria, quam quaesita, praecedit quod venit ab ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Crysostom.</note>
                     <hi>quod sequitur ex labore: gloriam beatius est habere, quam quaerere,</hi> that is a greater glory which is born with a King, then that which is gotten by him, that which commeth from descent goeth before that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth from industry: it is more happy to have glory then to seeke it. When <hi>Moyses</hi> was put into the water, it was most likely that some fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or some one dealing in the waters should have found him; but Gods providence brought thither the Kings daughter that by her he might be taken up. For as <hi>Macarius</hi> noteth, <hi>quum Deus Moysem praenosset &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinasset futurum ducem &amp; redemptorem populi,</hi>

As if God himselfe would not that he should come to the Scepter of government, who was not first ennobled. The same may be observed of <hi>David,</hi> whom God having annointed to be King of <hi>Israel,</hi> before he placed him on the throne he ennobled him in being the Kings Son in law. When <hi>Abimelech</hi> had made himselfe King, and <hi>Jotham</hi> the only Son of <hi>Gideon,</hi> which had escaped from the slaughter of his brethren, standing upon the top of mount <hi>Gerizim</hi> spake unto the men of <hi>Sichem,</hi>

                        <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.18.</note> that which chiefly he objected against <hi>Abimelech</hi> was, <hi>that being the Son of a hand mayd he was made King.</hi> For though <hi>Abimelech</hi> were a most cruell bloody man, and a foule murtherer of his brethren, yet this he omitterh, and speaketh only of his base birth, as if that were enough to prove, that he could not be a good King over them. <hi>And thy Princes eate in due season for strength, and not for drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> as before it was the misery of a Kingdome, that the Princes were like to the King in want of wisdome and goodnesse; so here it is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of a Kingdome, that the Princes are like unto the King in vertue and carefull government. And surely as it is the blessednesse of a Land to have them to be so, so it is the great glory of a Noble King to make them to be so. The <hi>eating</hi> here also as I shewed in the former verse may be taken for a civill consuming, as being such a one as consumeth in the strength and power of justice, which alwayes observeth due season, and not in the drunkennesse of passion, and corruption of lustfull desires. For so the Hebrew is <hi>in strength, in drunkennesse.</hi> Or else we may take the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to set forth those Princes, who as Saint <hi>Hiorome</hi> expoundeth him, <hi>nequaquam voluptatem negotiis rivium praeferunt,</hi>

But that which most plainly and most directly the words doe declare, is the commendation of temperate feeding in Princes, and a shunning of the excesse of a riotous and voluptuos gluttony: is a taking of sustenance in due season for peserving of nature, not for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:177008:192"/> of it; For as God is said to give all their meate in due season, so all must take it in due season, and to a due end, in a due manner.

The presenting of cups is not frequent, so that thirst doth rather blame the rarity of it, then drunkennesse refuse it. What should I say much?

                     </gap> being a word of the duall number, and therefore may well be translated, <hi>pigritia duplici</hi> by a double slothfulnesse as <hi>Buxtorfius</hi> renders it. <hi>Tremellius</hi> reads it <hi>pigritia ambarum,</hi> by the slothfulnesse of both. S. <hi>Hierome</hi> renders it, <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritiis,</hi> as if it did import no more then our English expresseth <hi>by much slothfulnesse.</hi> But I conceive the duall number to have reference not to the two hands of man, in which slothfulnesse appeareth, but to those two of which the former verses speake before, namely the King and Princes of a land. For here the Preacher by the similitude of an house and decay thereof, sheweth the decay of a Kingdome and state. And indeed a King in his palace may see a pattern and model of his Kingdome. For what are his out houses, but as it were his commons, or his people? What is his Guard-chamber, but his Souldiers and men of warre? What is his Presence-chamber, but his officers and magistrates in whom his authority is alwayes present? What is his Privy-chamber, but his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellers? What is his closet, but his nobles? who are admitted in more reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednesse unto him, and who are commonly close about him? What is his Chappel, but his clergy? What is his cabinet, wherein his jewels are kept, but his children? What is his Bed-chamber, but his Queene? What are the severall roomes and parts of his house, but the severall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes of his kingdome? And in the decay of his Palace he may see the decay of his kingdome and state. For as <hi>slothfulnesse</hi> not looking to <hi>the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the raine makes it <hi>to decay,</hi> so by carelesnesse and negligence in a King and his Princes, the Kingdome decayeth, groweth rotten and weake. If the King be <hi>a child,</hi> there cannot be but carelesnesse in him, for that is proper unto children; if the Princes be given to pleasure, <hi>to eate in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> there will be carelesnesse in them, for that a desire of pleasure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bringeth. And where carelesnesse is, <hi>a decay</hi> is sure to be. The Preacher also sheweth, where the decay beginneth. It is first <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>contignatio</hi> the roofe of the house that decayeth, first the King decayeth in his honour and reverence, then the Princes decay in their estate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, lastly it breaks through and comes to the people, and they suffer decay many wayes by it. <hi>For through idlenesse of the hands, the house droppeth through:</hi> the Originall is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>dimissione manuum,</hi> by the hanging downe and letting fall of the hands. And therefore we may so take the words, as to conceive the Preacher here to speake of a double kind of idlenesse and carelesnesse, the one in neglect of humane help, the other of divine help by not lifting up the hands in prayer unto God. For it is he that must keepe the kingdome from decaying, or else the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:177008:193"/> watcheth but in vaine. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> applyeth this verse two wayes. In a publick reference unto the Church,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>

In a particular reference he applies it unto that house which is erected in the state of every man, and to that dwelling, which we have in heaven. For if we shall be slothfull, and slowe to good works, that will decay and fall, <hi>&amp; omnis contignatio quae debet culmen por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare in sublime ad terram corruens habitatorem suum opprimit,</hi> and all rafre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or rearing up which ought to have a top on high, falling to the earth oppresseth him, who is the dweller in it. When the labour of the hands, the succour of the vertues is grown idle, tempests that come from above, and the showres of raine doe breake in upon us. <hi>Gregory Nyssene</hi> also in a particular reference understandeth the house to be the building of vertue in every particular man: for as, saith he, if the tymber which keepes the house together be weake and unsound, and he that dwels in it be slothfull in taking care of it, and looking unto it, the covering will be for no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, because the raine will pierce in through it.

And so it is both in the publick condition of any kingdome and Church, and in the private condition of every particular man.

The Preacher having shewed the hurt which commeth to a land, whose King is a Child, and whose Princes eate in the morning: here he sheweth the good which ariseth to a land, whose King is the Son of nobles, and whose Princes doe eate in due season. So <hi>Cajetane</hi> joyneth this verse to the former, who saith, those things belong to that blessed land spoken of before, namely abundance of bread wine and mony. For it is meete that a good King and temperate Princes doe govern the city or kingdome in abundance of bread wine and silver, <hi>&amp; abundantia panis describitur perfacere panem risui,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cajetauus in hunc vers.</note> by making bread for laughter, for the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall word, which is translated feast in the first place signifieth bread. Or else to referre this verse to that which goeth immediately before it, as there the Preacher sheweth the mischiefe of lazinesse and sloth; so here we may understand him to shew the benefit of labour and paines, from whence commeth plenty noted by <hi>feasting and wine,</hi> pleasure and delight noted by laughter, wealth and greatnes of estate noted by <hi>mony, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth to all things.</hi> The last part of the verse, the Septuagint doe render, <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gento humilitatione obediunt omnia,</hi> all things by subjection doe obey mony. And if it be referred unto those Kings, who are the Sons of Nobles, the words shew, how they by their humanity, alacrity liberality, doe bind their subjects to them. <hi>Egesippus</hi> writing of <hi>Antipater</hi> saith that by nation
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:177008:194"/> he was an <hi>Idumaean,</hi> among his owne descended from nobles, <hi>non tenuis pecuniae, &amp; ideo praevalidae potentiae, arte mira factus ad contemnendam pecuniam propter conciliandam gratiam,</hi> not of small wealth and therefore of great power,<note place="margin">Egesippus l. <hi>1.</hi> Excid.

                     </note> being a man composed by a wonderfull art to contemne mony for the getting of love. <hi>Tremel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> refers this verse to that which goes before, but he referreth the words to them, who voluptuosly eate in the morning, whose buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by slothfulnesse decayeth, and whose house droppeth through by idlenesse, <hi>quum omnia in luxum profusa sint,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tremellius in hunc vers.</note> seeing all is spent in luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious living: and then he readeth the last part of the verse thus, <hi>quorum pecunia facit, ut ista omnia respondeant,</hi> whose mony maketh that all those things answere unto their lustfull desires. <hi>Lyra</hi> also referreth the words in the same manner unto the same persons, and then expressing their <hi>feasting</hi> jollity he saith according to Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and the vulgar Latin, <hi>in risu facient panem &amp; vinum,</hi> in laughter they make bread and wine: in laughter, that is in foolish idle mirth,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> they make bread and wine, that is <hi>disponunt mensam,</hi> they furnish and make ready their table. For he tels us that the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> here used and which signifieth <hi>facere</hi> to doe or make, is sometimes used to signifie <hi>disponere</hi> to order and dispose: as when it is commanded of the captive woman whom an <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi> would have to be his wife, that she shall shave her head and pare her nailes, the Hebrew is <hi>faciet ungues,</hi> she shall make her nayles, that is,<note place="margin">

Now because where there is larg <hi>feasting</hi> and a plentifull table, there needeth much mony, therefore saith he it follwoes according to Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> and the Vulgar Latine <hi>pecunia obediunt omnia,</hi> all things obey money, that is, to get money they are ready to do any thing, <hi>&amp; subvertunt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium propter divitum munera,</hi> and they overthrow judgment for the gifts of the rich. Our translation sets downe the verse as if it were a sentence by it selfe, and as shewing that whereas <hi>a feast is made for laughter only, and wine is drunk to make merry only, that money serveth for all things.</hi> The Preacher expresseth the force of money by a <hi>Prosopopeia,</hi> and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the things to be endowed with speech and understanding, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth money to give a satisfactory answer to whatsoever is asked, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, commanded.

They are but fooles therefore over whom mony hath so great command, they are but fooles, who are so affected with it, that as <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> expoundeth this part of the verse, <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gento quovis trahuntur, vili pretio nihil non humile &amp; vile parati facere,</hi> by mony they are drawn any where,<note place="margin">Gregor.

But in the last place not to omit Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> who thinketh this verse to depend upon the former, and understanding the verse before of the slothfulnesse and carelesnesse of those, who rule in the Church, here he conceiveth the Preacher to speak of the same, and to condemne them, because they teach and preach those things, which may delight the people, which may nourish sinners in their sinful courses, and raise up unto themselves an applause among their hearers. <hi>Nonne quando in Ecclesia lascivit orator, &amp; beatitudinem &amp; regnum caelorum multitudini pollicetur,</hi>

For so he readeth the text. The last part of the verse, <hi>that to mony all things obey,</hi> he applyeth two wayes. Either that such teachers, being grown rich by their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and plausibility, <hi>regnum in populos exercent</hi> doe even reigne over the people. Or else because silver in Scripture is often taken for speech, he conceiveth the Preacher to meane, <hi>quod eloquentiae &amp; orationi, quae verborum sit fronde composita, facile vulgus cedat ignobile,</hi> that the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble common sort of people, doe easily yeild to eloquence and speech which is composed of the leaves of words.</p>

The Preacher having shewed the evill government of a King and his Princes, and the hurt which from thence the land suffereth, least hereupon any might be emboldned being moved by anger or fury to curse the King or the Princes he giveth direction here whereby to take heed of it: because it commeth to passe even beyond thought, that though it be done even <hi>in thought</hi> only or never so secretly, yet it is made knowne to them who are cursed, and danger is incurred by it. <hi>Curse not the King:</hi> the originall word <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore it is also the manner to make choice of that roome for a bed-chamber which is most private; and hence it is that the Preacher here speaketh of a bed-chamber, as noting the greatest privatenesse that may be, and where that which is said may be heard by no one.

According as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour speaking to the charitable saith, <hi>come ye blessed of my father inhreit the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of world.</hi> And the whole chapter is devided into three parts.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.34.</note> First he exhorteth unto the works of charity, unto the sixth verse. Secondly unto a speedinesse in these works, from the sixth verse unto the ninth, and there lastly he inferreth the conclusion of his purpose in the two last verses. The first part is subdivided into two parts, and first he exhorteth to the exercise of charity in the three first verses.<note place="margin">Lyra in hoc cap.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he removeth the impediment which might stop the speed unto it in the fourth, and fifth verses: thus <hi>Lyra</hi> giveth the division of the chapter. <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> directly according to the Originall reads it, <hi>mitte panem tuum super faciem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tremell. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>quia in multitudine dierum invenies illum,</hi> Send thy bread upon the surface of the water, and in the multitude of dayes thou shalt find it. And so most literally the words seeme to say, that as that which is carried by the water is at length found in the ocean, where the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of waters is gathered together; so that which is given to the poore is carried into heaven, and there shall be found in the endlesse multitude of dayes, wherein shall be gathered together the multitude of all good things. <hi>Cast thy bread,</hi> that is saith <hi>Tremellius,</hi> thy seed, the seed of thy good works,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> the bread which is made of the seed by a Synecdoche being used for the seed. But though he who soweth his land doth sow seed, yet as <hi>Saint Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>qui largitur egentibus
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:177008:197"/> non granum seminis, sed ipsum panem serit,</hi> he that giveth to the poore soweth bread and not the grains of seed. Wherefore we may well enough take the word without a figure. <hi>Cast thy bread upon the waters:</hi> that is saith <hi>Saint Hierome ad eleemosynam cohortatur,</hi>

                     <hi>quod omni petenti sit dandum,</hi> he exhorteth so unto works of charity, as that wee should give to every one that asketh. The French translation reads it, <hi>cast thy bread aval l'eau</hi> along as the waters go, and as occasion is offered unto thee so be still casting thy bread, be still shewing thy charity. And to this sense as I conceive doth the vulgar Latin read it, cast thy bread <hi>super transeuntes aquas</hi> upon the waters passing along, and as still any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion passeth by the, let it not passe without thy bread cast upon it, thy charity shewed some way or other. <hi>Tremellius</hi> reads it, cast they bread <hi>secundum aquam</hi> by the waters, and giveth it this meaning, that as they who sow their seed upon fertile ground, which is neere unto waters, by which it is watered, do expect a plentifull crop from it; so the Preacher would have us to sow the works of charity, from whence we may expect a plentifull reward. And indeed God being alwayes full, so that his bounty cannot be exhausted, he loveth those that doe so carry themselves, and so dispose their wayes, as that their works may still expect a great reward from him. He is not liked by God, that spendeth his time so, and so consumeth his means, as that he cannot look to reape any fruit by it. He is approoved by God that maketh every bit of bread to bring great gaine unto him. Wherefore <hi>Saint Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>nunquam quum veniat Dominus, inveniat imparatos, sed semper vultus suspensos expausosque sinus habentes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard. Ser. <hi>17</hi> in Canti.</note>
                     <hi>ad largam Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni benedictionem,</hi> let the Lord when he commeth never find us unready, but alwayes with our faces looking up towards him, alwayes having our bosomes open, our laps spread abroad as looking to receive a large blessing from him. For God desireth that we should be like unto them, who waite for their Lord when he will returne from the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>quod utique ab illis supernae mensae copiosis deliciis vacua nunquam revertitur manu,</hi> because from the abundant danities of the heavenly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he never returneth with an empty hand.<note place="margin">Catena Graeca.</note> Or else we are here bid <hi>to cast our bread upon the waters,</hi> as teaching us that when we give our almes, to the poore, we should also have a fellow feeling of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and that as misery wringeth teares from the poore, so compassion should wring the same from us. So doth the <hi>Catena Graeca</hi> expound these words saying, <hi>Cum Sympathia &amp; lachrymis fac eleemosynam tuam omni transeunti;</hi> with teares and Sympathy of griefe bestow thine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes on every one that passeth by. <hi>Cassiodore</hi> writing of some moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes called <hi>Lactari montes</hi> the milky montaynes, on which the beasts that feed doe give such norishing milke, that mens bodyes pined and consumed away doe thereby not onely receive strength and health but fatnesse also, whereas the beasts themselves are exceeding leane, so that as <hi>Cassiodore</hi> expresseth it, <hi>mero modo herbis animalia non profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt, unde hominum membra pinguescunt, exiles per dumeta excurrunt
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:177008:198"/> montium, tenues videntur, &amp; instar ejus cui medentur sustinent passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> after a wonderfull manner the beasts doe not profit by that grasse, by which the bodyes of men grow fat: they go up and downe neer the thickets of the mountaines leane and thin,<note place="margin">Cassidor. var. l. ver. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> and as it were sustayning the condition of those, who are healed by them. Like to these beasts should charity make us, and as we comfort the poore with the milke that we give them, so we should as it were sustaine their distresse by a fellow feeling sorrow with them. Or lastly we are bid <hi>to cast our bread upon the waters,</hi> to teach us that our charity should be free and liberall and alwayes flowing as the waters are. <hi>For thou shalt find it after many dayes:</hi> that is although the waters may seeme to carry thy bread away, and thou mayest seeme to be no whit the better for it; yet it shall not be so, but thou shalt find it againe, and find it to thy great comfort and benefit.<note place="margin">Gregor. Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat in hunc vers.</note> Thus doth <hi>Gregorius Thaumaturgus</hi> expound the words saying, <hi>quamvis id statim perdidisse videas quemadmodum si panem in aquam conjecisses, tamen progressu temporis nequaquam infrugifera ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parebit beneficentia,</hi> although thy charity may seeme to some to be forthwith lost, as if thou hadst cast thy bread into the water, yet in processe of time thy bounty shall appeare not to be unfruitfull unto thee <hi>Or else, thou shalt find it after many dayes,</hi> that is although thou doe not find it presently, yet be not impatient, distrust not a reward, for though it be long before thou see the comfort of thy charity requited yet be sure of it, for it shall come at last, and make a large recompence for the delay of it. Let me therefore say unto thee as one doth, <hi>mitte panem tuum super aquas, &amp; in verbo Domini promitto tibi, quod post multa tempora invenies,</hi> cast thy bread upon the waters, and cast thy care upon mee, for in the word of the Lord I promise the, that after many dayes thou shalt finde it. Yea let it be but a piece of bread that thou castest, and thou shalt find it to be a tree of of life unto thee.

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Give a portion: Saint Ambrose</hi> speaking of these words saith, <hi>primum quaerendum nobis est, quid sit unde partes facere praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. Est namque quoddam bonum, &amp; ipsum est summum bonum, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas videlicet, quae nisi partiatur perfectum bonum non est. Partitur enim in dilectione Dei, &amp; in dilectione proximi,</hi> the first thing that wee are to seeke for is, what that is of which wee are commanded to make <hi>a portion.</hi> For there is a certaine good, and it is the chiefest good, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely charity, which unlesse it be devided is not a perfect good. It is devided therefore into the love of God, and into the love of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.<note place="margin">Ambros. m. c. <hi>2.</hi> Apocal.</note> The charitable love of our neighbour is devided into as many parts, as are there persons that stand in need of it. This therefore it is that the Preacher here saith, <hi>give thy portion to seven and also unto eight.</hi> That
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:177008:198"/> is saith <hi>Lyra da abundanter,</hi> give abundantly:<note place="margin">Tremell. in hunc vers.</note> that is saith <hi>Tremellius distribue quam plurimis potes,</hi> give to as many as thou canst. Cajetane telleth us that the old Jewes in honour of the seven first dayes did give their almes unto seven persons as contented with that number.<note place="margin">Cajetan. in haec verba.</note> And that therefore the Spirit of God doth here admonish them to give a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto seven and unto eight also, as if it were said, doe not set those bounds unto thy charity,<note place="margin">Nazianz. Orat. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> so that if need be thou be not ready to go beyond them. But it seemeth by <hi>Nazianzene</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> did take their custome of giving unto seven from this passage of Scripture, as if they were commanded to give to seven only, and that eight was added as a thing left unto their own pleasure; he therefore speaking of <hi>Porreus</hi> a Bishop saith, <hi>pauperum inopiam quantum poterat sublevans, partemque dans non septem duntaxat, velut Solomonis lex praescribit, verum si octavus accederet, libentius sua profunderet, quam alii acquirunt;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the wants of the poore, as much as he could, and giving a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only to seven, as the law of <hi>Solomon</hi> prescribeth, but if an eight did come, bestowing that which he had as willingly, as others doe get that which they have not. And indeed it is the glory of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to disperse it selfe to many, not only to those, that are of our kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, but to those also that are not, not only to those that we know, but to those also that we know not, not only to those of the same place with us, but to Strangers also, not only to those that are of the same religion with us, but to them also that differ therein from us. The manner of the ancient Christians, being to doe so, and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state envying them for it, he gave order to his Officers to build hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls for travellers, <hi>Xenodochia,</hi> in which they should receive all, even Christians also, who were hatefull to him without any difference, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by that bountifull means, the Disciples of Jesus had won the hearts of all. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> considering that passage of the women,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.1.</note> who had bought spices, that they might embalme Jesus, thereupon, saith, <hi>non ad ungendum tantum aliquam corporis partem, videlicet pedes aut ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put, sed ut venientes ungerent Jesum, quod est totius corporis complexio.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard.</note>
                     <hi>Tu quoque si te induas viscera misericordiae, liberalem benignumque te exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas erga omnes,</hi> it was not to anoynt some one part of his body, namely his head or his feet, but that comming, they might anoynt Jesus,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.9. <hi>V.</hi> 10</note> which comprehendeth the whole body of him. And doe thou also,<note place="margin">Tertull. advers. Hermogen.</note> if thou dost put on the bowels of mercy, shew thy selfe liberall, and bountifull towards all. When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Jerusalem, Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> gave him the right hand of fellowship, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith of it, <hi>de officii distributione pepigerunt,</hi> they made a covenant with him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the distribution of the ministery, that he and <hi>Barnabas</hi> should goe to the heathen, and they unto the circumcision, only they would that they should remember the poore. That was a thing to be done every where, that was to be done among the heathen, as well as among the circumcision, that was to be done to <hi>eight,</hi> the Gentiles, as well as to <hi>seven</hi> the Jewes. <hi>For thou knowest not what shall be upon the earth,</hi> that
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:177008:199"/> is, thou knowest not what misery, what calamity shall come, wherein the charity which thou hast shewed, may be a means to move God to preserve and to deliver thee. For <hi>godlinesse hath not only the promise of the life to come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</note>
                     <hi>but of this life also.</hi> Or else, as <hi>Lyra</hi> speaketh, <hi>forte eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niet mortalitas hominum per pestilentiam aut gladium, in qua toleris de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta praesenti;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>&amp; tunc opera pietatis valebunt tibi, quia sola pietas est comes defunctorum ut dicet Augustinus,</hi> perhaps a mortality of men shall come either by the Pestilence, or else by the Sword, in which thou shalt be taken away from this present life, and then thy works of godlinesse will be profitable unto thee: for godlinesse onely is the companion of the dead, as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> expounding this verse, It is, saith he, <hi>ac si aperte diceretur, sic dispensa temporalia, ut appetere non obliviscaris aeterna. Oportet namque ut in posterum bene agendo provideas, qui de venturo judicio quanta tribulatio sequatur ignoras. Hinc est quod quindecim gradibus templi ascenditur, ut ex ipsa ejus ascensione discatur, quatenus per septem &amp; octo temporalis solicite dispensetur actio, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide mansio aeterna requiratur,</hi> as if it were plainly said, so dispose of temporall things, that thou forget not to seeke after eternall things. For it behoveth thee that by doing well, thou provide for the time to come, who knows not what calamity may follow in the judgement that is to come.<note place="margin">Gregor. Moral. l. <hi>35.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> Hence it is that the temple ascended up by fifteene steps, that by the very ascending of it might be learned, how by seven and eight both our temporall actions might be ordered carefully, and our eternall mansion might be sought for providently. The ancient fathers are very much in finding out some mystery in the first part of this verse, and in the numbers seven and eight. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Sancti itaque Dei par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes septem dant amoris sui,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros. in c. <hi>2.</hi> Apocalyp.</note>
                     <hi>quam in exercitiis vitae activae occupantur, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delicet quum curam proximo non solum carnalem sed &amp; spiritualem impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt. Dant etiam partes octo quum eos amor Dei ad contemplationem ejus revocant,</hi> the Saints of God therefore doe give to seven, portions of their love, when they are busied in the works of an active life, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they bestow not only a carnall, but a spirituall care upon their neighbour. They give also portions to eight, when the love of God calleth them back againe to a contemplation of him. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out here the mysterie of the two parts of the Scriptures, and in the number <hi>seven,</hi> the Old Testament, because of the Sabbath of the Jewes, in the number <hi>eight</hi> the New Testament, because of the resurrection. And shewing that the Jewes did give their faith only to the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the number <hi>seven,</hi> that <hi>Marcion,</hi> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks did give their faith only to the number <hi>eight,</hi> to the new Testament rejecting the old, he concludeth, <hi>nos utrique credamus instrumento. Non enim possumus dignos cruciatus dignamque paenam jam nunc mente compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendere, quae reposita est his qui versantur in terra Judaeis atque haereticis e duobus alterum denegantibus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> let us therefore beleeve both instruments. For we cannot now comprehend in our minds, the deserved tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the deserved punishment, which is laid up for those that
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:177008:199"/> are upon the earth, Jewes and haereticks, that doe denie either of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> shewing how in the condition of this life, we all stand in need one of the other; &amp; that not only he that receiveth alms,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Homil. <hi>17.</hi> in <hi>2.</hi> ad Corinth.</note> standeth in need of him that giveth it, but he that giveth it also standeth in need of him that receiveth it: giveth this reason of it, <hi>nisi enim pauperes essent, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus nostra magna ex parte profligata esset, ubi enim pecunias serere possemus, non haberemus,</hi> because unlesse that there were poore, our salvation would be in a great part hindred, because we should not have where to sow our money. Now with this metaphor, the Preacher having begun this chapter,<note place="margin">Tremell. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Tremellius</hi> conceiveth him to continue the same in this verse, and that here he sheweth, that as God blesseth the seed that is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and by <hi>the raine of the full clouds,</hi> maketh it to be fruitfull; so he blesseth also the works of charity, and maketh them fruitfull in much comfort and happinesse. Wherefore taking also the Originall word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> here used to signifie <hi>plantam,</hi> a plant, for so himselfe translateth it, hee giveth this meaning of the latter part of the verse, that as wheresoever the plant falls, there the owner of it is sure to find it, and to receive fruit of it, so he that doth the works of charity, shall be sure to find and receive the fruit and reward of them. Now this meaning is both reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and most true. When <hi>Alexander</hi> set forward unto his great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, before he went from <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he devided to his captains and friends all that he possessed. For which, when one of his friends repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, saying that he was prodigall, because he had reserved nothing for himselfe: the answere which <hi>Alexander</hi> gave, was this, that he had reserved much unto himselfe: namely, hope of the Monarchy of the world, which by his valour, and helpe of those his captaines, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he hoped to attaine. And surely, though to some, he that giveth unto the poore, may seem to be prodigall, yet in respect of the hope, which he hath of profit, he is frugally wise. Neither is his hope such as <hi>Alexanders</hi> was, which depended on the uncertainty of warre, but it is grounded upon the certainty of Gods word. But as those excellent and most learned men doe many times fetch their translation afarre off, so it is not seldome that they goe far to bring home the sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. It seemeth to me, that wee may reach the Preachers mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning neerer hand. For having first exhorted unto charity, in the first verse, secondly having commended to our charity, many persons in the second verse, here he proceedeth to the measure of our charity, and would have it to be full. The Psalmist speaking of a good man, saith, <hi>he hath dispersed, he hath given to the poore,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 112.9.</note>
                     <hi>his righteousnesse endureth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his horne shall be exalted.</hi> And here the Preacher having exhorted us to disperse our charity to many; next he exhorteth us to give to them freely. <hi>For as the clouds being full of raine,</hi> doe readily <hi>empty themselves upon the earth,</hi> which is under them; so he would have them, who are full of abundance, freely to give to the poore, and to satisfie the want of them, who by the meanesse of their estate, are in a low condition.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:177008:200"/> And this he would have them to doe, while they have time of doing good, and when now in their lives they may provide how it shall be with them after death, because <hi>as the tree falleth, either toward the North, or toward the South, there it shall be.</hi> But there is also somthing more to be noted in the words. For they may be rendred out of the Originall thus, <hi>if the clouds be full, they empty the raine upon the earth,</hi> for so <hi>Pagnine, Arias Montanus,</hi> and the French translation doe reade the words. Now the Originall word here used for raine is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a great and strong raine, as Rabbi <hi>Kimchi</hi> affirmeth: so that wee are taught, that as the clouds, being full, doe give great store of raine, so they who are full of the blessings of this life, should not be scant in affording reliefe unto them that want it. If thou be an Olive tree, a fat tree, be also a greene Olive tree, as the Prophet saith that he was, and bring forth much fruit in thy works of charity. For how canst thou pray as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Have mercy upon me, O Lord, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy loving kindnesse,</hi>

                        <hi>Malachi.</hi> 1.14.</note> Doth not the Prophet <hi>Malachy</hi> tell us, <hi>cursed is the deceiver, which hath in his flocke a male, and sacrificeth to the Lord a corrupt thing?</hi> Where he is called a deceiver, because having wherewith to doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by his offering he maketh himselfe, as it were, not able. But yet how many such are there in the world,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Homil. <hi>17.</hi> ad populum.</note> and whereas Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh, they ride on horses with golden chains, and lie on silver beds, and use much more pompe, yet when they come to give to the poore, <hi>pauperrimis redduntur pauperiores,</hi> they are made more poore then the poorest. <hi>Alexander Quintus,</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> said of himselfe, That when he was a Bishop, he was rich, when he was a Cardinall, hee was poore, and when he was Pope, hee was a beggar; and plainly so it is with many, who the richer they are, still are the poorer, in respect of their giving to the poore. Now if we read the former part of the verse so, and take it in this sense, then we may understand the latter part of the verse thus, that <hi>as the tree falling towards the South, lyeth there,</hi> so when a worke of charity is done with a warme devotion, accordingly it is by God accepted: <hi>and as when a tree falleth towards the North, it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there,</hi> so when a worke of charity is done with a cold devotion, it is accordingly by God esteemed. But generally the ancient Fathers, and latter expositors doe understand, or at least apply the latter part of the verse with reference unto death. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith, <hi>Where the tree falls whether toward the North, or towards the South, there it shall bee, in diem enim mortis suae justus ad austrum cadit peccator ad aquilonem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregor. Moral. l. <hi>12.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>

Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, Man is a tree, which by death is cut downe, and wheresoever he falleth, there hee shall be, because there God judgeth him, where death findeth him, and there he shall be without any change. <hi>Videat ergo quo casura sit, antequam cadat, quia postquam ceciderit, non adjiciet ut resurgat, sed ut nec se vertat,</hi>

Now which way he shall fall, if any one will know, let him marke his boughs, for where the boughs are most and greatest, on that side there is no doubt that his fall will be. Our boughs then are our love and our desires, and from them our actions, by which we are extended towards the South, if that we love spirituall things chiefly: if carnall things be more weightie with us, then are wee extended towards the North, and accordingly, when we die will these make us to fall, make us to lie.</p>

                     <hi>vasta tempestas irritum faciat totius anni laborem,</hi> when the grains of corne are mixed with chaffe, let them be severed by wind. A west wind is accounted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for this businesse: but yet to stay for it, is a signe of a lazy hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man, because while it is expected, the hard winter overtaketh us. Wherefore the threshed corne is so to be laid together in the barne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floore, that upon every occasion it may be winnowed. And if for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, the wind be still and quiet every way, let it be cleansed with fannes, least after too much dulnesse and slacknesse of the winds, a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous tempest overflow the labour of the whole yeere: To apply it to the verse. He that delayeth the works of his charity, expecting, as he saith, the fittest occasion, as if the husband-man should stay his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowing, expecting a westerne favorian wind, sheweth his charity to be cold in him: and perhaps some tempest, some affliction shall arise, which may deprive him of his means, and make him unable to sow, unable to exercise his charity. In generall, the meaning of the verse is, that as he who scrupulously <hi>observeth the wind, regardeth the clouds,</hi> oftentimes overpasseth his sowing, looseth his reaping; so he that sheweth not his charity, but in a curious observing, how, when, and to whom he doth it, looseth the sowing of much seed, looseth the reaping of much fruite. To consider the thing more particularly. And first, as for him that curiously considereth unto whom he giveth, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>qui considerat cui tribuit, saepe praeterit eum qui meretur accipere,</hi> he that considereth on whom he bestoweth his almes, oftentimes passeth him

                     <hi>give to every man that asketh of thee:</hi> if his necessitie make him to aske, let thy charity make thee to give. What though he be an ill liver?<note place="margin">Chrysost. Conc. <hi>2.</hi> de Lazaro.</note> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tells us <hi>non moribus demus sed homini, nec illius ob suam virtutem nos misereatur, sed ob calamitatem,</hi> let us not give to the manners of the man, but to the man, neither let us have pitty of him in regard of his vertue, but of his misery. The same Father tells us,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Ibid.</note>
                     <hi>Portus in necessitate constitutorum homo misericors,</hi> a mercifull man is the haven of them that are in distresse. Wherefore as in a tempest the haven receiveth all that flye unto it, whether good or bad, so a mercifull man bestoweth his charity upon all, and though he rather helpeth them, that live well, yet all that be in want shall have his reliefe. Secondly as for him that observeth when he will give, and as the scrupulous hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman observeth the wind, regardeth the clouds, so he stayeth untill the poore body sue unto him, or untill some friend whose favour he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth, doe speak for him, what doth he but loose the sowing of his charity? what doth he but loose much comfort which he might reape?

Doth not saith he the raine fal before thou askest for it? Doth not the sun arise while thou art in thy bed? Doe not the fruits spring while thou thinkest not of them? And dost thou ô man sell a little bread for much asking? <hi>Magnum opus est eleemosynae, ut faciat homo, quod facit Deus,</hi> the great work of charity is that man doe as God doth. Thirdly as for him that curiously observeth how he giveth, and as he that observeth the wind soweth not least the wind should blow away his seed, as he that regardeth the clouds reapeth not fearing the frounes of the skye, so he feareth to shew his charity in any great manner, least himselfe should come to want; let him heare, what <hi>David</hi> saith <hi>he never saw,</hi> saying, <hi>I have been young,</hi>

When our Saviour Christ had fed foure thousand with seven loaves and a five fishes,<note place="margin">Augustin.</note> all being filled, seven baskets full of fragments were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up: and it is Saint <hi>Austins</hi> note upon it, <hi>crescit dum impendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur victus, sic eleemosyna si indigentibus erogetur,</hi> the victuals in spending were augmented, and so is the almes which is given to the poore. By allusion Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> applyeth this verse unto them,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> who preach the word of God in that time only when the people are willing to heare: whereas saith he, <hi>oportunè importunè suo tenore Dei sermo est praedican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, nec fidei tempore adversariarum nubium consideranda tempestas,</hi> the

                     </gap> some doe translate <hi>ventum</hi> the wind, taking their direction as it seemeth from the former verse, where the wind is spoken of. Others doe translate it <hi>Spiritum</hi> the spirit, being guided as it seemes by the latter part of this verse, which speaketh of the forming of man in the wombe of his Mother. Thus our translation readeth it, and therefore so to consider it. I am first of all moved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider why the Preacher should joyne this with the argument of charity, and it maketh me to thinke that the works of charity doe make God in a more especiall manner to blesse the fruite of the wombe,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.8.</note> and to give to them children, who doe give to his children in their distresse and want. I am sure that it was so with the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> and she having provided a chamber and furnished it for the Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> God provided a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for her child, and furnished her with fruit of her wombe. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> noting the same and speaking of it, saith, <hi>Sunamitis illa magna mulier in superioribus hospitium paravit, &amp; ibi concipiendae sobolis meruit praerogativam, ibidemque resuscitati pignoris vidit miraculum,</hi> that great woman the <hi>Shunamite</hi> prepared an upper lodging for the Prophet, and there it was that she obtained the prerogative of conceiving a child, there she saw the miracle of her son restored unto life. But to consider the verse, what is more divine, what more admirable, what more secret then the forming of man in <hi>the wombe? Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Physitians</hi> may study much about it, as which part first liveth, which is first formed, and whether all be formed together, but <hi>Galen</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Galen.</note> said well, the question is so difficult and hard to be resolved, as that it is known to none, but to God and nature.

Moreover not one but many are the <hi>bones</hi> of mans body, and man being made to be apprehensive in understanding, stirring in action, capable of the representation of sensitive things, and accordingly to follow diverse objects to which his desire should carry him, therefore motion was bestowed upon him: whereas if he had consisted but of one bone, how could he either have bowed any way, or any way reached out his body to any thing, either by going to it or taking of it? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God therefore for the use of mans life, and for the exercise of the severall motions of the body, hath strangly composed the body of a pack or set of bones, of diverse sortes and manifold shapes. Now this variety is likewise very usefull, that when one bone receiveth any hurt, thereby the others might not be hindred in their offices. And yet though many be the bones of mans body, such is the connexion of them, and so wonderfully are they fitted together, that all are as it were but one by that contiguity which is betweene them. The totall compage and set of the bones is called a <hi>Syntaxe</hi> and the fabrick of the bones so fitted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is called a sceleton. Of which how they are made, how joyned together, how fitted so, who can tell but <hi>he that maketh all?</hi> But to apply now the verse unto the Preachers argument in this place, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thus of it. The Preacher here, in our charity would have us to imitate God in this great worke of his: <hi>for thou knowest not the way of God</hi> when he formeth the bodyes of children, and giveth soules unto them of whom he fore knoweth that they will be wicked, and that they will imploy both unto his dishonour: <hi>thou knowest not the way of God,</hi> when he giveth substance and life to children of adultery and fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as he doth to them who are born in wedlock, and of whom he foreknoweth that they will serve him and feare him. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this God doth, and doe thou so likewise in thy workes of charity, although thy poore foreknowledge may think, that what thou givest will be spent in naughtinesse. Againe he that is in the wombe knoweth not what is done for him, knoweth not who it is that doth it; he doth not aske it, he doth not desire it, God himself alone seeth, what is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and he doth all for him. And doe thou so likewise, doe thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow thine almes on him that knowes thee not, on him that asketh not of thee, and cannot tell from whence it commeth to him. To this Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> exhorting thee, saith, <hi>videndus est ille, qui te non videt, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendus est ille qui erubescit videri: ille etiam clausus in carcere occurrat tibi, ille affectus aegritudine mentem tuam personet, qui aures non potest,</hi> he is to be seen by thee, who doth not see thee, he is to be sought out who is
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:177008:202"/> ashamed to be seen by thee, let him meete thee who is shut up in prison, and let his voice who lyeth sick a bed sound in thy mynd, which cannot sound in thine eares. Againe that which God worketh in the wombe is all done in secret, and is hidden from the eyes of all: let thy workes of charity be done so likewise, let them be done in secrecy, not in osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and let not thy left hand know, what thy right hand doth. Lastly thou knowest not how the Spirit comes into the child, how the bones are set up and strengthned, yet thou findest it to be done: wherefore give unto the poore and spare not, and though thou knowest not how it commeth to passe, yet thou shalt find thine estate to be strengthned thy substance to be encreased, the blessings of God to be upon thee and multiplied towards thee. It were a vaine thing to feare, when a child is conceived least the Spirit should not find the way into it, or least the bones should not grow in him, and no lesse vaine is their feare, who are troubled least by giving to the poore, their estate should decay, and that either themselves or theirs should be brought to misery. <hi>Leo</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith, <hi>non timeatur in his expensis defectio facultatum quoniam ipsa benignitas magna substantia est, nec potest charitati deesse materies,</hi>

                     <hi>ubi Christus pascit, &amp; pascitur. In omni hoc opere illa intervenit manus, quae panem frangendo auget, &amp; erogando multiplicat;</hi> in these expences let not a failing of means be feared, because bounty it self is great wealth, neither can the matter of bounty be wanting, where Christ himselfe feedeth, and is fed. In every such worke that hand is a fellow worker, which encreaseth bread by breaking it, and by giving multiplyeth. And surely as God doth wonderfully by building up the house of mans body in his mothers wombe, so doth he oftentimes wonderfully build up their houses, who are free in the workes of charity. Wherefore Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>in haec aedificia studeamus evacuare pecunias nostras, nec fabris nec structoribus nec operariis opus habebimus: manus namque pauperum tales domos aedificant &amp; non mireris,</hi>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. Great is the worke of God in framing of man, and it cannot but be a great admiration to man, to consider, how as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Hieron. in hoc caput.</note>
                     <hi>ex vili elemento corpus hominis in diversas effigies artusque variatur, &amp; de eodem semine aliud mollescat in carnibus, aliud durescat in ossibus, aliud in venis palpitet, aliud in nervis ligetur,</hi> from one vile matter and beginning, the body of man is divetsefied into diverse shapes and limbs, and of the same seed, some is mollified into flesh, some is hardened into bones, some beateth in the veines, some is bound up in the nerves and sinewes. And surely wonderfull also is the worke of God to him that shall consider it, how from one small graine, and that rotten in the earth, the blade springeth up, the blossome flourisheth,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:177008:203"/> and many graines are brought forth and ripened. To this the Preacher here returneth, and goeth on by the similitude of sowing to exhort us to the workes of charity and godlinesse. Now good works are like unto seed, because as from one graine of seed many seeds are gathered, not at the time of sowing, but at the end of the yeere; so from one good worke we shall gather a great harvest not forthwith perhaps when we do it, but at the end of our lives. But if thou sowest, let it be <hi>thy seed,</hi> let it be thine owne, let it be of thine owne that which thou dost, sow not with the seed of another man, for then thou sinnest, thou sowest not. And indeed thou mayest possesse much lawfully and justly, yet it is that only which thou sowest, that is truly thine. The rest of the good things of this life which thou hast, are not so much thine as the worlds. And when thou leavest thy great estate, which by much labour thou hast gotten to thine heires, to thy friends, it is their seed which thou sowest not thine owne, for they reape the harvest of thy paines and care. They are thy good works only, which the world shall not keepe from thee, they are thy workes of charity, which thou shalt not leave to thine heires and freinds, but shalt carry with thee into heaven, and there thou thy selfe shalt reape the endles and unconceivable comfort of them. <hi>Sow</hi> therefore <hi>thy seed,</hi> and sow <hi>in the morning, and in the evening with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold not thine hand,</hi> begin betimes, and when thou hast begun make not an end at any time.<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Matutinam justitiam vespertina inveniat, &amp; vesperi misericordiam solis ortus accumulet,</hi> let the evening find thy morning righteousnes, &amp; let the morning adde unto the evenings mercifulnesse, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh. And here note, that there is here no mention made of the night, no sowing then is to be used, that being the time of death: wherin none can work. But while life continueth, sow in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and in the beginning of it, sow in the evening &amp; the end of it, let no time be omitted. Againe note that the morning &amp; the evening make the whole life of mā: it is but a day. To our understanding it seemeth in some to be very long, if that it exceed an hundred years: but so doth a groate seeme a great deale of mony to him that is very poore, whereas by a rich man it is accompted as nothing. And let this shortnesse of our life make us to be the more diligent in sowing. If a great King should bring us to a great heape of gold, and should bid us for one day to take out of it as much as we could, would we not then be sure to begin early <hi>in the morning, and in the evening would we withold our hand?</hi> Now thus God dealeth with us, he giveth to us one day to gather and to get as much as we can, not of fading earthly treasure, but of immortall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory, and shall we then loose any time? The reason which the Preacher further addeth to presse us to a plentifull and diligent sowing, is this, <hi>because thou knowest not whether shall prosper this or that or both:</hi> the word translated <hi>prosper</hi> in the Originall as <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:177008:203"/> the Septuagint <hi>nescis quod magis oriatur,</hi> thou knowest not which shall rather spring up. The French translation hath it; <hi>lequel escherra mieux,</hi> which shall fall out better whether that which is done at one time, or that which is done at another. In generall that which the reason sheweth, is this, that for sowing, for doing good, every time may be as good as any time. Indeed for reaping there is a set time, and that time must be tarryed for and observed, which is the good time which God seeth upon the earth, and the glorious time which he hath appointed in heaven; but for <hi>sowing</hi> for doing well every time serveth, and who knoweth which shall doe best in the acceptance of God, and in the advancing of our blessednesse. Be therefore diligent and sow continually. It is not <hi>in sowing</hi> as it is in buying and selling, in those, things are done by weight and by measure, but in sowing, there is a scattering abroad in a free and full manner. Wherefore when it is said of the righteous man, he hath dispersed, he hath given to the poore, <hi>Theodoret</hi> noteth upon it, <hi>Imitatur serentes large semina &amp; dissipantes ab manipulorum spem,</hi>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. This verse may be considered either as having reference to that which goes before, or else as beginning some new matter. As it hath reference to that which goes before, so it may also be considered
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:177008:204"/> diversly. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> taking it to have reference unto the former verse understandeth it, as shewing the happinesse, which shall be to them, who are diligent to sow their seed in the morning, and constant in sowing untill the evening.<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> And therefore he saith, <hi>Si semper bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feceris, &amp; omni aetate aequalem cursum habueris, videbis Deum Patrem dulcissimum lumen, videbis Christum solem justitiae,</hi> if thou shalt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alwayes to doe well, and in every age of thy life shalt hold an equall course of Godlinesse, thou shalt see God the Father, who is a most sweete light, thou shalt see Christ who is the Sun of righteousnesse. And applying the evening and the morning in the former verse by allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion unto the old and new Testament, he thereupon exhorteth us so to seek spirituall understanding in the old Testament, as that we doe not thinke that which we read to be contained in the Evangelists and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles only: <hi>ignoramus enim nos in quo magis scientia nobis à Deo tribuatur &amp; gratia, faelicemque eum esse qui utrumque in commune sociaverit, &amp; quasi unum corpus effecerit: quod qui fuerit consecutus videbit lucem, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debit Christum solem justitiae,</hi> because we know not in which rather knowledge and grace from the Lord may be given to us. So that he is happy who shall have joyned both of them together, and shall have made one body of them: which he that hath obtained, shall see light, shall see Christ the Sun of righteousnesse. But as the verse is referred to the former, and to the generall argument of charity, whereof the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding part of the chapter speaketh, it may be also taken and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as containing an impediment in the works of charity which the Preacher removeth, as <hi>Lyra</hi> conceiveth it: or as containing an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against the works of charity, which the Preacher answereth as <hi>Tremellius</hi> apprehendeth it. The objection conceived to be made may be thus expressed, why should I spend my means upon others, which I have gotten for my selfe? Why should others have the fruit of my labours? I will my selfe enjoy the <hi>sweete</hi> delight of it, I will my selfe take pleasure in it, and while I have <hi>the light</hi> I will cheare mine owne heart, while <hi>mine eyes behold the Sun,</hi> I will please mine eyes with the objects of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. Or if I doe help others, I will first serve my selfe, I will first <hi>sweeten</hi> mine owne life <hi>in the sweete light,</hi> I will first shine in the pleasures of mine owne wayes, <hi>while the Sun shines upon mee.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith well,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Homil. de misericordia &amp; duabus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duis.</note>
                     <hi>Tria sunt quae in misericordiae opere op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanda sunt Christiano, ut possit facere, ut velit, ut compleat,</hi> there are three things which in the work of charity a Christian ought to desire, that he may be able to doe it, that he may be willing to doe it, and that he may accomplish his will and doe it. That he may be able, and that the means of doing may not be wanting, that he may be willing and that a mind of doing may accompany the means, that he may doe it, and that he may without delay accomplish that which he can, and to which he is willing. For there are saith he, which can and will not, which will but cannot, which can and will but doe not by delaying of it. Wherefore he concludeth, <hi>Qui potest facere, oret ut velit, &amp; qui vult
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:177008:204"/> oret ut possit, &amp; qui utrique paratus est det operam ut misericordiam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanter efficiat, ne quod vult &amp; potest differendo non compleat,</hi> Iet him therefore that can doe it, pray that he may be willing, Let him that is willing to doe it pray that he may be able, let him that is ready in both, be carefull that he doe it quickly and diligently, least by deferring he doe not performe that which he is both able and willing to doe. Or else as the verse containeth an impediment to the works of charity it may be thus expressed, <hi>the light</hi> of this life is a pleasant thing, and it is a delightfull thing <hi>to behold the Sun</hi> in this world, let us therefore use that which we have for our comfort and delightfull contentment here. Why should we give away our means in hope of happinesse and joy which is to be had hereafter? <hi>Ova in praesenti sunt meliora pullis cras,</hi> egs for the present are better then chickens too morrow, let us rather reape now the pleasures of the earth by spending our means upon our selves, then sow in expectation of blessednesse by giving unto others. And I wish that this impediment could be removed out of the hearts of many, which is not so much an impediment of the poores reliefe as of their owne salvation. But to consider the verse also as the beginning of a new matter, and as our translatours have set downe. The first thing that ever was commended is <hi>the light,</hi> and as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh, <hi>jure prima laudatur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambr. Hexam. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>quoniam ipsa fecit ut etiam caetera mundi membra digna sint laudibus,</hi> justly is that first praised because that made all the other parts of the world to be worthy of praise. He that goes about to build an house, before he lay the foundation considereth with himselfe, where he shall make windowes in it, that so it may have light, that being the chiefest grace of the house, and without which the house hath neither comfort nor comelinesse. By this therefore the Preacher here expresseth the comfort of this life. And when he addeth, <hi>it is a pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the Sun,</hi> he doth not meane the direct fastning of the eyes upon the Sun, for that paineth the eyes and taketh away the sight of them: but he speaketh of beholding the brightnesse of the Sun shining upon us. And fitly doth he speake of <hi>beholding</hi> this brightnesse. For as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> also noteth,<note place="margin">Ambr. Hexam. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Lucis natura hujusmode est ut non in mensura, non in pondere ut alia, sed omnis ejus in aspectu gratia est,</hi> for such is the nature of light, that not in number, not in measure, not in weight as other things, but in beholding consisteth all the grace of it. And therefore also fitly doth he expresse the prosperity of this world by it, which is all in shew and in apperance to the eye, not in substance and worth. But if it be <hi>so pleasant to behold the Sun</hi> of this world, how pleasant is it to behold the Sun of righteousnesse. If this <hi>Sun</hi> be so swift that by his speedy course he vieweth over all things in one day &amp; night, how great is he who is alwayes present every where? and who by his majestie filleth all things? If the <hi>Sun</hi> be wonderfull, who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to run his race, how wonderfull is he who speaketh to the Sun and it stirreth not? If this <hi>Sun</hi> be so great which by the chang of time every day approacheth unto places, and goeth away from them
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:177008:205"/> againe, how great is he, who when he imptyed himselfe that we might behold him, was that true light which enlightneth every one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world? If this <hi>Sun</hi> be so glorious, which by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the earth is darkned,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.6.</note> how great is his majestie, who shaketh the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. The Preacher here removeth the impediment, answeareth the objection, and to him that esteemeth so much of this present life he saith, suppose that thou <hi>shouldest live many years;</hi> to him that desireth to delight himself he saith, suppose that <hi>thou shouldest rejoice in them all;</hi> yet there are dayes to follow, dayes as long as now thy yeares are, <hi>dayes of darknesse,</hi> wherein the light of life shall be quite put out, wherein the comfort of pleasure shall be quite lost. And they shall be <hi>many</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, not many as thine years of life were, that is thy small accompt, but so many as that they cannot be numbred, of which it can be said only that they are many, but it cannot be said how many they are. In the yeares of thy life therefore <hi>remember</hi> these dayes, in thy dayes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light remember these dayes of trouble and let the remembrance of them make thee to provide against them, by well ordering thy life, by well governing thy delight, by sparing something out of it to comfort those who are in misery. When <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren making a relation unto him of their condition and family told him, thy servants are twelve bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Genes.</hi> 42.13.</note> the Sons of one man in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and behold the youngest is this day with our Father and one is not, <hi>Philo</hi> notes upon it,<note place="margin">Philo.</note>
                     <hi>haec de seipso loquentes audiens tanquam de mortuo, quid animi mali habere potuit?</hi> hearing them to speak these things of himselfe as of one dead, what revengfull and evill mind could he have against them? For indeed the remembrance that wee must once be dead, cannot but strike into us a care how we live. When <hi>Samuel</hi> had anoynted <hi>Saul</hi> to be King, to confirme unto him the truth of the joy, and withall to teach him how to be carefull in governing his joy, he gave him this signe, when thou art departed from me to day, thou shalt find two men by <hi>Rachels</hi> sepulchre.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.2.</note> For he that findeth in his mind a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his grave and sepulchre, will not easily be found exorbitant in his delights and joy. But though, as our translation maketh the verse to belong unto a new argument (for so the contents of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sheweth) we may conceive it in this generall consideration, the summe whereof <hi>Eusebius</hi> gives us saying, <hi>per salutiferas gradimur vias, quando anima damnatis voluptatibus cogitat quando sepositura sit taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum hujus corporis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Euseb. Gallic. Homil. <hi>1.</hi> de Epiphan.</note> then doe we go on the wayes of safety, when the soule rejecting pleasures doth rather thinke of that time, when it must lay aside the tabernacle of this body. Notwithstanding in regard of referring this verse unto the matter, whereof the Preacher before in this chapter speaketh, we are to conceive his meaning, that he would have the remembrance of death to stirre up men unto the works of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And what can doe it more forcibly? For that being a time when we are to be brought unto the judgement seate, that then we may find
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:177008:205"/> the judge to be mercifull, the way is to shew our selves mercifull unto the poore.<note place="margin">Chrysost. Homil. <hi>5.</hi> de Paeniten.</note> Wherefore Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaking of pacifying the judge saith, <hi>non pecunia, imo si verum dicere oportet pecunia placabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus per inopes accepta, da pauperi, &amp; judicem mitigabis,</hi> it is not by mony to be done; or rather to speake the truth, by mony receaved by the poore we shall appease him, give to the poore and thou shalt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the judge. That is a time when we would have Christ to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge us, and when we are ready to acknowledge him: but is was by breaking of bread that our Saviour was made knowne unto those men that went to <hi>Emaus:</hi> and thereupon Saint <hi>Austin</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31.</note>
                     <hi>discite ubi Dominum quaeratis, discite ubi habeatis, discite ubi agnoscatis; panem frangimus &amp; Dominum agnoscimus,</hi> learne where ye may seek the Lord, learne where ye may have him,<note place="margin">Augustin. ser. <hi>144.</hi>
                     </note> learne where ye may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, we break bread to the poore, and we know the Lord. That is a time, when we desire to be delivered from the torments of hell, and how ready is charity to keepe us from them? Wherefore S. <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>ante fores gehennae stat misericordia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Austin. Homil. <hi>39.</hi> Homil. <hi>50.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>&amp; nullum miserecordem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit in carcerem illum mitti,</hi> mercifulnesse standeth before the gates of hell, and suffereth no mercifull man to be cast into that prison, so that as the flaming sword doth keepe us out of paradise, in like manner mercifulnesse doth keepe us out of hell. But if the remembrance of death cannot make us to be charitable, at leastwise let the neere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of death bee able to doe it. And as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Si vivens non pavisti, saltem migrans, quum jam non es Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ultra, da tuorum bonorum partem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chrysost. Hom. <hi>25.</hi> ad populum.</note> if living thou hast not fed the poore doe it when thou art dying, and when thou canst no longer keepe thy goods, give some part to the poore. Then make him in part an heire together with thy frinds, who to make thee an heire of heaven was contented to lay downe his life for thee. It is best to doe the works of charity in thy life, but if thou hast not done them before, thou maiest at the last moment of thy life make God to be gracious unto thee by them. The last part of the verse, <hi>all that commeth is vanity,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a confirmation of that which goeth before, and being thus to be conceived, all that commeth into this world, goeth away againe, and as a vanity vanisheth, sheweth that men, who come into this life, must go out againe; that the things enjoyed in this life shall againe be lost; and therefore that how sweete soever the joy may be that by any is taken in them, it shall at lenght passe away and be shut up in darknesse. For as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Bernard. Ser. <hi>4.</hi> in octava Epipha.</note>
                     <hi>quum de transitoriis quis laetitiam quaerit, non poterit non transire transeuntibus his, de qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus erit,</hi> when any one seeketh joy in transitory things, it cannot but passe away, when the things passe away in which it is. Wherefore seeing the world passeth away, and the lust thereof, it cannot be, but that all wordly joy doth so likewise.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> observing that here the Preacher saith, <hi>rejoice ô young man in thy youth,</hi> and that in the next verse he saith, childhood and youth are vanity, or as he reads it <hi>adolescentia &amp; voluptas vana sunt,</hi> youth and pleasure are vaine, thereupon saith, <hi>quid est hoc, quod vel prius reprehendenda praecipit, vel post praecepta reprehendit? nisi quod ipsis literae verbis innuit, ut qui difficultatem exterius patitur, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis intelligentiam consideret, quam sequatur? Quae nimirum verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis intelligentia quum per cordis humilitatem quaeritur, assiduitate legen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di invenitur,</hi> what is this that either the Preacher doth first command those things, which are to be reprooved, or that afterwards he doth reproove those things, which he hath commanded? unlesse it be that by the very words of the letter he doth imply unto us, that he who findeth difficulty without, should consider the understanding of the truth, which he may follow. And surely the understanding of the truth, when it is sought for by humility is found by the earnest dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of reading. To consider therefore the understanding of this verse, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> because it seemeth that it is delivered by way of command understandeth it in a religious sense, and thus expoundeth it, <hi>rejoyce ô young man in thy youth, non unius tibi dicit tempus aetatis, est quasi quidam flos vitae bonorúmque aetas operum, de qua scriptum est, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novabitur sicut aquilae juventus tua. Et oblectet inquit te cor tuum in diebus adolescentiae tuae, &amp; ambula in via cordis tui sine macula &amp; in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectu oculorum tuorum, &amp; non in audacia oculorum tuorum. In aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu utique spirituali, non audacia saeculari. Et scito quod super haec om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia adducet te Deus in judicium,</hi> he doth not speak unto thee of one time of thine age, it is as it were a certaine flower of life, and an age of good works,<note place="margin">Ambros. de hort. ad virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitat. Psal. <hi>103.5.</hi>
                     </note> of which it is written, thine youth shall be renewed as the youth of an eagle. And he saith, <hi>let thine heart delight thee in the dayes of thy youth, and walke in the wayes of thine heart,</hi> without spot, <hi>and in the sight of thine eyes,</hi> not in the boldnesse of thine eyes, namely in
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:177008:206"/> a spirituall sight non in wordly boldnesse. <hi>And know that for all these things God will bring thee to judgment.</hi> Or els if wee understand the verse as a precept, wee may also conceive it in a literall sense thus; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce o young man, and let thine heart cheare thee, and walke in the wayes of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes,</hi> but doe it so, as that thou know and consider; that for all these things God shall bring thee into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For as an ancient writer saith, <hi>ita praesentis temporis est agenda laeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ut nunquam amaritudo &amp; timor sequentis judicii recedat a memoria,</hi> So is the rejoycing of this present time to be used by us, as that the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and feare of judgement to come be never forgotten by us. But as he that seeth evill will be done, may bid it to be done, when as he would forbid it much rather, if thereby he could stop the doing of it, so it is here with the Preacher. He saw that youth would be unruly, and that loving pleasure it would walke in the wayes of sinfull contentment and in the vanity of the sight of the eyes: wherefore he bids them to doe it by way of an irony, as the Jews say, but yet shewing also his meaning to be, that he would not have it to be done and that it ought not to be, he addeth, <hi>know thou that for all these things, the Lord will bring thee into judgement.</hi> Wherefore to view the words more particularly. <hi>Rejoyce o young man in thy youth &amp; let thy heart cheere thee in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> that is, doe thou cheere thine heart, and let thine heart cheere thee, by taking contentment in them, and by giving unto thee a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of spirits and of jolity from them.

The Septuagint, and the Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine doe also read it, <hi>aufer iram a corde tuo,</hi> take away anger from thy heart,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> and the exposition which <hi>Lyra</hi> giveth of it, is, by anger to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand revenge, <hi>quam solent juvenes magis quaerere quum senes propter cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditatem naturae,</hi> of which yong men are more desirous then old, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the heate of their nature.

But if wee read it indignation, as the Hebrew word most properly doth signifie, I conceive that it may be understood of the angry fretting and chasing of the heart against the day of judgment, whereby sinners are checked in their pleasures, and forced sometimes to sadnesse, when they would be merry. So that we may understand the Preachers meaning to bee; be not angry in thy mind against the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, for thou shalt not be able to avoid it; but put away evill from thee, and so thou shalt escape the evill of it. Or else the <hi>anger</hi> may be understood of that anger which is in young men, when they are reprooved and blamed for their faults, which the Preacher would have them to <hi>remove from their hart,</hi> that good instruction might be the better received.

And to them it is that the Preacher here directeth his speech, it is to keep them from danger, it is to preserve them in the flower of Gods favour, that he saith, <hi>Remember thy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, &amp;c.</hi> The memory of man is indeed a most excellent faculty, being that thing whereby we preserve those things which time hath spent and wasted, whereby the things that are absent, are still present, and the things that are gone from us, doe abide with us. Indeed it is that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the life of man would be most wretched and miserable. <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> therefore saith well, He that keeps not in memory the things that are past, hath little better then lost his life given him in this world. Now if our memory be so excellent a faculty, how great reason have wee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our Creatour, by whom it hath been bestowed upon us? should not God remember us in his Providence and protection over us? should not he remember us in troubles and distresses, and when we have cast our selves away in our sinnes; what would become of us? But though God be most graciously mindfull of us, how little mind have we of him? Wee say of one that he hath a good memory, because he keepeth firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a long time, that which he hath received: we say of another, that he hath an excellent memory, because he can repeate many things as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as they are proposed unto him. But he hath a good memory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that remembreth good things carefully, he hath an excellent memory, that remembreth God, who is good above all things. <hi>In the dayes of thy youth:</hi> a chiefe reason that makes young people, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member God their creatour, is this, because they thinke that they have a long time to live in the world, and though they forget him now, yet they will remember him hereafter. But to remove this, the Preacher saith, not in the time, but <hi>in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> to shew both to young and old, that our life is but for a few dayes. And <hi>Seneca</hi> saith well, that though death be before the old mans face, yet he may be as neere to the young mans back, let him therefore, while he hath day, <hi>remember his Creatour in the dayes of his youth.</hi> Indeed the Creatour must alwayes be remembred, not only in youth, but in old age, not only in the dayes of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:177008:209"/> youth, but all the dayes of our life. For as <hi>Zachary</hi> saith, <hi>That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, that we might serve him in righteousnesse and holinesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>all the dayes of our life;</hi> so he hath created us, that we might remember him all the dayes of our life. It was the fault of <hi>Solomon</hi> who gave this good rule, and did himselfe in his younger yeeres observe it, that in his old age he forgot the Lord, who is alwayes to be remembred. But yet espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>in youth,</hi> because then it is most acceptable to God, then most needfull in respect of man. God should not have the worst, but the best of our dayes, and when it is the worst of mans danger, then should he be most carefull to looke unto himselfe, by having his Creatour in his mind. <hi>Aristotle</hi> shewing the pronesse of youth unto vice,<note place="margin">Aristot. Polit.</note> giveth these particulars of it, that he is eager in desire, that he is bold in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, that he is changeable in mind, that he is confident in hope, that he is presuming upon his knowledge, that he is prone to anger, that he is ready to make knowne whatsoever is in his heart. But if youth shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his creatour, he will remember to moderate his desires accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his creatours law; to feare the displeasing of him, and therefore not to be bold in enterprises; to be setled in a good course, which he approveth, and then not to change it; to put his trust in his Creatours goodnesse, and in his blessing upon him, and not in his owne vaine hopes; to know that he knoweth nothing as he ought, and not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume upon his owne knowledge; to be slow to anger, that he sinne not in his anger, and make his Creatour to be angry with him; lastly to keepe his tongue with watch and ward, that his Creatour may keepe him safe from his enemies. <hi>While the evill dayes come not:</hi> the evill dayes are the dayes of old age, because many are the evills that old age brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, according as the Poet speaketh,<note place="margin">Horatius.</note>

But here we may also conceive <hi>the dayes</hi> to be called <hi>evill,</hi> because when the dayes of youth are not well spent, the dayes of old age are hardly brought to goodnesse. Wherefore Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaking of old age, saith, <hi>Stimulant eum peccata sua,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambrosius.</note>

That burden of obedience yeeres that are ripe doe hardly bare: but tender yeeres doe not feele the trouble of heavy weight, by the increase of vertue which is growing in them. <hi>Nor the yeeres draw nigh when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them:</hi> he spake before of <hi>the dayes of old age,</hi> as speaking of the beginning of it, when the evils being lesse and fewer they are but dayes of evill: here he speaketh of <hi>the yeeres of old age,</hi> as speaking of the latter time of it, when the many and great evils of it, doe make a man to say, <hi>that he hath no pleasure</hi> at all in them. This time Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> describing saith, <hi>Capilli fluunt, facies in pallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem mutatur, dentes lapsi numero minuuntur, cutis arescit, flatus non suaviter olet, pectus suffocatur, tussis cachinnat, talos &amp; pedes tumor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flat, etiam interior homo qui non senescit, his omnibus adgravatur,</hi> the hayre fals away,<note place="margin">Cyprian. de abusionib. saecul.</note> the face is turned into palenesse, the teeth shedding are lesned in their number, the skin is dryed up, the breath smelleth not sweetly, the brest is stopped, the cough makes a great noise and laugheth as if were at mans infirmities, swelling pufs up the legs, ankles and feete, and the inward man, which cannot grow old, is oppressed with all these. <hi>Plutarch</hi> relateth that it was the saying of <hi>Cato</hi> the elder, that whereas with old age many reproches are joyned, and seeing that it is affected with many evils, the reproch of the evill of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis not to be added to it:<note place="margin">Plutarch. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothegm.

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. As the Preacher having first exhorted unto vertue generally, doth more particularly exhort unto the vertue of charity in the chapter before; so having first shewed the vanity of mans life generaly he doth here more particularly shew the vanity and misery of old age: which he having began to doe in the end of the former verse he proceedeth in it. Now the manner of his speaking being metaphoricall, it may be taken diverse wayes: and first, as <hi>Tremellius</hi> doth, by <hi>the Sun, light, Moone and Stars,</hi> we may understand comfort, by the darkening of them sorrow, it being the usuall manner of Sripture by light and darkenesse to expresse consolation and misery. And then we may farther note that the <hi>Sun and the light</hi> doe signifie the comfort of the day, the Moone and the stars the comfort of the night:<note place="margin">Tremell. in hunc vers.</note> so that the Preacher sheweth, that old age hath comfort neither night, nor day: but when it is day it saith, when will the night come, and when it is night it saith, when
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:177008:210"/> will the day appeare? And old age speaketh as blessed <hi>Job</hi> doth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job.</hi> 20.26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27.</note>
                     <hi>the dayes of affliction have taken hold upon me, my bones are peirced in me in the night season, and my sinewes take no rest.</hi> And againe it hath the same language, <hi>I am made to possesse months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, when I lye downe, I say, when shall I arise, and the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone? I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.</hi> And this continuall misery it is; which the Preacher farther expresseth, when he saith <hi>nor the clouds returne after the raine:</hi> that is saith <hi>Tremellius, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que calamitates subinde succedunt aliae aliis, ut in senectute fit,</hi> neither doe calamities follow one upon the neck of another, as in old age it commeth to passe. Or else by these last words, we may understand the great molestation of rheume and fleame wherewith old age is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; the defluxion of the rheume and fleame being as it were <hi>the raine,</hi> the gathering of new matter, which continually distilleth being as it were <hi>the returning of the clouds after the raine.</hi> From this misery of old age, saith Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> are they reprooved, who thinke this alone to be life, which is led in this world. <hi>Non intelligitis senectutem hanc miseriarum esse veteranam, processionemque aetatis aerumnarum stipendia, &amp; Scyllaeo quodam usu, circumsonari nos quotidianis naufragiis, tundi fluctibus, &amp; in scopulosishabitaculis degere,</hi>

                     </note>
                     <hi>sicut illud non tam aeternum animal quam immortale malum?</hi> Doe ye not understand this old age to be as it where an old Souldier in the war of miseries, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of yeeres to be the reward of troubles: and that then, after the manner of <hi>Scylla</hi> as it were, on every side we heare the sound of dayly ship wracks, that then we are beaten with waves, and have our abiding in rocky dwellings, as it were that living crearure which is not so much eternall as an immortall evill. Wherefore saith he, behold, just, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Godly <hi>Abel,</hi> and for the favour of his devotion incurring his brothers hatred <hi>immaturus adhuc aevi sublatus est parricidio,</hi> unripe as yet in time and age is taken away by parricide: naughty, wicked, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>Cain</hi> and polluted also with his brothers murder, <hi>long aevam duxit aetatem,</hi> liveth to be an old man. <hi>Lyra</hi> understanding the verse more plainly taketh it to expresse the decay of the sight in old age. Which is not able to see either by day the brightnesse of <hi>the Sun</hi> when it shineth, or <hi>the light</hi> of it, when it is clouded, nor by night either the weaker light of <hi>the Moone,</hi> or the lesse light of <hi>the Stars.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>And the returning of the clouds after the rayn,</hi> he expoundeth <hi>esse tribulationem mortis super tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulationem senectutis,</hi> to be the tribulation of death following the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation of old age. But because this verse seemeth to have a more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary reference unto the beginning of the former verse, where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the creatour is called for, we may understand the words thus. Let him be remembred, while <hi>the Sun is not darkened,</hi> that is, while youth continueth, or if not so, while <hi>the light</hi> of the Sun is not gone, that is, while thy manhood lasteth, or if not so, while <hi>the Moone is not darkened,</hi> that is, while thine elders yeeres are not spent, or if not so, while <hi>the Stars</hi> are not shut up, while the worst of old age hath not seised
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:177008:211"/> upon thee.<note place="margin">Philo de mundi opificio.</note> For so <hi>Philo</hi> distinguisheth betweene elder yeeres and old age, telling us, <hi>vir usque ad quinquagesimum, senior usque ad sextum su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra quinquagesimum, quicquid vero deinceps sequitur ad senium pertinet,</hi> manhood continueth unto fifty yeeres, from thence unto fifty six we are said to be elders, whatsoever followes after that belongeth unto old age. To this care of early remembring the creatour betimes, Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> applyeth those words of our Saviour, woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those dayes, and thereupon saith,<note place="margin">Ambros. de Abel &amp; Cain l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>maturius igitur absolvatur hic partus, ut cogitationes nostrae bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum processionibus explicentur, ut nihil imperfectum finis noster inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat, nihil tanquam in incude positum usus nostri operis relinquat,</hi> let therefore this birth be perfected more speedily, let our purposes of good workes be manifested by the proceedings of them, let our end find nothing imperfect, let the practise of our weldoing leave nothing upon the anvil as it were unfinished. Woe be to them that are with child of goodnesse in their old age, or that then doe only give sucke. And then we may understand the last words thus, <hi>nor the clouds returne after the rayne,</hi> that is a difficulty of doing well doe not follow the neglect of it. Or else by <hi>the Sun</hi> we may understand divine grace, by <hi>the light</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane underhanding, by <hi>the Moone</hi> the Church, by <hi>the Stars</hi> the teachers in the Church. For sometimes such is the naughtinesse of old age, that the checks of grace, the light of understanding, the authority of the Church, the instruction of teachers are things darkened unregarded, unperceived by it. When, as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> speaketh; sometime it is so buryed in a delight of drinking, <hi>quasi ad hoc arida viscera &amp; succo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausta curventur, ad vigorem pristinum reparandum ebrietatis inundatione riganda sint,</hi> as if the dry entrailes and exhausted of moysture were to this end bowed and weakened,<note place="margin">August. de Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore Serm.</note> that they might he watered with the overflowing of drunkenesse for the recovery of their former vigour. Or else when sometimes the gulf of covetousnesse is so unsatiable, that as the same Father speaketh <hi>tanto ad acquirendum ferventius inardescit, quanto citius relictura est quod acquiritur, mirabili, insania</hi> it burneth by so much the more fervently after getting, by how much the sooner it is to loose that which is gotten, by a wonderfull madnesse. And then we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>the returning of the clouds after the raine,</hi> to be the adding of one sin to another. Or lastly by <hi>the Sun</hi> we may understand reason, by <hi>the light</hi> knowledge, by <hi>the Moone</hi> imagination, by <hi>the Stars</hi> the senses, and so we may conceive the Preacher to speake of the time, when death is at hand, and when all these commonly doe faile, so that it is nere too late to remember the creatour. And then by <hi>returning of the clouds after the rayne,</hi> we may understand the returning of the body to the earth after the dissolution of it from the soule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. <hi>In the day:</hi> it is to encrease the misery, that the Preacher calleth it a day, as noting a continuance of life, when death is more desireable. <hi>When the keepers of the house shall tremble:</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> tels us, that they who did refer this passage of Scripture unto the body
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:177008:211"/> of man, did thinke that by <hi>the keepers</hi> here were understood the ribs,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>quod ab ipsis intestina vallentur, &amp; tota ventris mollitudo servetur;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by them the entrailes are walled, and the whole softnesse of the belly is preserved.<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>Lyra</hi> here by <hi>the keepers</hi> understandeth the senses which as he saith, <hi>praecavent corpori a noxiis,</hi> watch to keepe the body from those things that would be hurtfull to it. But seing the word <hi>tremble</hi> doth not well agree unto either of these expositions, as I conceive, by <hi>the keepers</hi> here we may best understand the hands. For though man arrive into this world as from a shipwrack, destitute and naked, yet God hath furnished him with two excellent helps, which no other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cteatures doe enjoy, reason and the hand. The hands therefore are said to be <hi>the keepers,</hi> because they doe keepe of hurt from man, who by them is able to preserve and safeguard himselfe from all other creatures. And all other creatures, which enter into the world armed at point, challenging as it were the injuries of the earth to assault them, how great soever their strength and feircenesse may be, how able soever they may be to endure any thing, yet are they not able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against the hands of man. The teeth of the Lion, the pawes of the Beare, the sting of the Serpent, the hornes of the Bull, yea whatsoever else nature hath made strong for her selfe acknowledge a weaknesse under mans hand, and yeeld the homage of subjection unto it. And to shew further how fitly the hands are said to be <hi>keepers,</hi> a chiefe property of <hi>keepers</hi> is faithfulnesse; now <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated the hands to faith, and the gnerall course of the world is to make and establish all bargains and covenants by the joyning of hand. And it is the use of some other countryes, that the oath of alleagiance is taken from the chiefe nobility in the hands of the Prince or his delegate. To say also something what is meant by the hands, the ancients doe understand all that which is from the shoulder to the fingers ends to be the hands. This part of the body <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Galenus</hi> subdivide into three parts, <hi>brachium, cubitum, &amp; extremam manum,</hi> the arme, the cubit, and the outmost hand. The name of arme we have from <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> who calleth it <hi>armus,</hi> and it is extended from the top of the shoulder to the next joynt, where is the bowing of the cubit, and which therefore in English is called the bow, all being but one bone, and next unto the thigh bone the greatest in the whole body according to <hi>Galens</hi> measure. The next part tearmed the cubit, is that which from the arme goeth a long unto the wrest, being made of two bones, whereof the one lyeth upon the other. The lower of those is the bigger, and is tearmed <hi>ulna</hi> the ell, the upper is the shorter and is called in Latin <hi>radius</hi> a rod, a wand. The last part which indeed properly and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly is the hand, containeth three parts in it, the wrest the afterwrest and the fingers. But to leave these things to <hi>Anatomists.</hi> That the hands might be the better keepers, God hath endued the hand with power to move it selfe five wayes, forward toward the brest, backward toward the back, upward toward the neck and head, downeward
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:177008:212"/> toward the side of the chest, and lastly to turne it selfe into a circle and compasse. But to these motions old age addeth one more <hi>motum trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dationis</hi> the motion of trembling, which spoileth and maketh uselesse all the rest. <hi>And the strong men shall bow themselves:</hi> that which our Translation reads shall bow themselves, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reads <hi>peribunt</hi> shall perish, the vulgar Latin according to the septuagint <hi>nutabunt</hi> shall nod or stagger: <hi>Aquila</hi> as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith did read it <hi>errabunt</hi> shall wander, and as the word most directly signifieth, the place as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive may be rendred, shall overthrow themselves. Now by these <hi>strong men</hi> are meant the feete, and the ancients doe meane by the foote all that which goeth from the hip joint to the farthest end, and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the toes. But yet they make a distinction, and the foote pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called they call the little foote, the other the great foote. The parts of the great foote are three, as the parts of the hand were, the thigh in Latin <hi>femur a ferendo</hi> because it beareth and holdeth up the creature, and is that which goeth from the hip to the knee, the leg which goeth from the knee to the heele, the little foote which is a foote indeed as being the base the ground and pedistall which sustaineth the whole building of the body. This is the true organ and instrument of going and walking and consisteth as the hand did of three parts, the wrest, the afterwrest, the toes. The strength of these parts which is the thing the Preacher here speaketh of especially consisteth in the bones which are numbred by <hi>Anatomists</hi> to be two and forty. But to touch only some of the principall: the longest bone in the whole body of man is the thigh bone, which in the length of it declineth some thing from an exact strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because at the knee it boweth inward, thereby to give the more stability and firmnesse unto the running, walking and standing of man. And therefore such men as are tearmed vary, having their thighes more straight then nature hath prescribed, are indeed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>in eundo</hi> troubled in their going. The top of this bone is of a great largnesse, and is fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a deepe hollow of the hip bone, thereby to give it the stronger articulation, because of the very great burden which lyeth and resteth upon it. This strength is also encreased by a very strong ligament, which arising out of the bowing of the hip and placed under the top of this bone fastneth and bindeth the two bones together. The leg is made of two bones, the one called the shin bone, in latin <hi>tibia</hi> a flute or pipe, either that being called so because it is like a flute, or else a flute being called so, because at first it was made of that bone taken from the leg of a hart. This bone is the inner and thicker. The other thinner bone is called the brace bone, resembling the braces of building, and joyning the muscles of the leg together, as they hold the beames of an house to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But the distinction which commonly is made, is to call the one the shanke, the other the shin-bone. Now that two bones were fitter to make up the leg then one, is by <hi>Galen</hi> prooved, for as much as the greatnesse and heavinesse of one would have been an impediment to the ready moving of it. But though the strength of these strong men
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:177008:212"/> bee so great, and that so well ordered, yet in old age it is enfeebled, when they bow under their burden, and are ready to overthrow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and the whole body. <hi>And the grinders cease because they are few:</hi> the Preacher here speaketh of the teeth, which both in Greek and Latin have their name from eating, being called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> and so <hi>dentes quasi edentes</hi> neither is our English word unlikely to be taken from thence. Now the teeth are the hardest of the bones, if that they be bones, for <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth only account them to be bony, and to have some likenesse with bones, at least he is doubfull whether he should reckon them to be bones or noe. And the truth is that there are no other bones so solid and so hard as they are,<note place="margin">Aristotel.</note> neither doe they come much short of the hardnesse of stones, if they doe not equall stones in the edges of them. To shew that they are not bones, this evidence is brought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the stone <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> so called, because it will consume flesh, and which within the space of forty dayes consumeth the whole body of man, yet doth not meddle with the teeth, whereas if they were bones they would be consumed as well as the other bones. The teeth also alone doe continue to grow as long as mans life continueth: because otherwise being worne out with dayly use of them, they would soon become unfit for use. And therefore they doe only grow so much after they are come to their full growth as they are worne away. This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>Faloplus</hi> to affirme, that the formative faculty liveth in the teeth as long as man himselfe liveth: as if thereby God would shew that he hath not made man to dye, having provided that by nourishment he should be still preserved. The seate of the teeth are the jaws, where they have their severall sockets into which they are mortised. The comely order of them in their places <hi>Galen</hi> tearmeth the seemly dance of nature. They are divided into three kinds, the foreteeth which serve for cutting of the meate, the sharp teeth, which serve for the breaking of that which the foreteeth cannot cut; and the grinders or cheeke teeth, which serve for the chewing of the meate. These being the greatest, the hardest, the chiefest are here alone mentioned by the Preacher, and they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led grinders, because in the unequall roughnesse and broad hardnesse of them, they are like the grinding stones of a mill, whereby as milstones, so they, are fitter for comminution: for which cause it is, that millers when their stones by continuall use are growne smooth, by picking doe make them rough againe. To set downe the number of these in man, is a thing uncertaine, because some have five, others foure, others three, but these are very few, in each side of their jawes. The two hindmost grinders being both bred and placed after the rest, <hi>Hypocrates</hi> tearmeth <hi>dentes sapientiae</hi> the teeth of wisedome, because they are bred about the twenty eight yeare of mans age, by which time men are supposed to have learned wisedome for the ordering of their lives and wayes. But in old age these grinders also faile, and having been often repayred, they are at length decayed: their mortising is loosened, their sockes cast them out, and though there be most of them, they also at last <hi>are few</hi> or none

For the reception of the formes of things into the eyes requiring a softnesse and a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the temper of them, and this softnesse and tendernesse making them obnoxious many wayes to offence and hurt: therefore God hath sheilded them most watchfully, the eyelids ever and anon thrusting themselves between danger and them. To which purpose God hath given to the upper eyelid a very nimble motion: and though it be doubted whether the under eyelid doe move at all, yet something it stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,<note place="margin">Arist. de partib.

These eyelids have haires set in them, being set there by God, before we come into the world, and that in such an exquisite order, with such an exact equality, for number and for magnitude, that by the addition or diminution of any thing their use as <hi>Gallen</hi> saith is marred and spoiled, and the eye not so well fenced nor sheltered. But though the dores be shut so carefully, the watch set so diligently, all things ordered so punctually yet in old age darknesse get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in and dimmeth the sight, which is at last extinguished and put out. Now let this admonish us, that while we have the use of these parts we be carefull to use them well, that when we want the use of them it may be a comfort to us to remember how well they have been used by us. As when we cannot use our hands, let it be our comfort, in what good la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour they have been imployed, when we cannot goe, let it be our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, how diligent we have been in going to Gods house, when we cannot see, let it be our comfort, how frequently our eyes have read the word of God, and other good bookes. Againe let this admonish us to live in Gods feare, while we enjoy the use of these parts, that when we doe not enjoy them, God may be our arme, God may be our staff, and that then by the eye of faith, we may behold him looking in mercy upon us.</p>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. <hi>And the doores shall be shut in the streets:</hi> some take this to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no more then the weaknesse of old men, in not being able to goe abroad, or the dulnesse of them, in not caring to goe abroad. Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> speaking of the first, saith, <hi>clausas in plateis portas infirmos senis gressus accipi volunt, quod semper sedeat &amp; ambulare non possit,</hi> by the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:177008:214"/> doores shut in the streets, they will have to be understood, the weak go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an old man, because he alwayes sitteth and cannot walke.<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> Of the second <hi>Tremellius</hi> understandeth the words, saying that they are so set downe, <hi>pro eo quod est à foro abstinere &amp; à frequentia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tremell. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>ubi delectatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem inventus percipit,</hi> for that which is plainly thus expressed, to abstaine from the market place, and from the entercourse of people,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> where youth findeth delight. <hi>Lyra</hi> by the doores in the streets, understandeth the lippes, which are seated in the plaine of the face, and which saith he, are said to be shut, because an old man cannot speak well. But the Preacher speaking here of the decay of the senses of man in old age, I conceive him in these words, to signifie the sense of smelling, by the streets importing the nostrils, by the dores those holes in the spungie bone, into which the odours are received. Now for a little fuller ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the meaning of the words thus taken. The nose, which is the instrument of smelling, is either inward or outward: the outward nose, which consisteth of the nostrils, addeth both beautie and majestie unto the face, and among the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> it was an <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of a wise man; from whence it is also that <hi>nasutus</hi> is sometimes used to expresse one that is witty, because witty men are able to smell out the cunning devices of others. The reason of the Latine name for nostrills, which is <hi>nares,</hi> some give to be this, because the odoriferous spirits which are in the ayre doe <hi>in nare,</hi> swim as it were continually up and downe in them. The inward nose is made of the spongie bone and mamillary processes. The spongie bone hath its name, from the crooked and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique holes of it, being therein for the most part like unto the crooked pores that are in a sponge. The mamillary processes have their name from the nipples of a dug, which in some sort they doe resemble, and which issuing from the lower part of the braine, are seated in the upper part of the spongie bone. Now the nostrils lead the ayre, as if it were through streets, informed with the forms of odors, through the dores and holes of this spongie bone, to the mamillary processes, where the faculty of smelling principally resideth, and from whence the braine is refreshed by them. But in old age the spirits being decayed, so that the mamillary processes are not so well furnished with them, though the streets and doores be open still, yet are they shut in respect of smelling, that being either altogether, or well neere lost. <hi>When the sound of the grinding is low:</hi> these words speak of that time, when in old age the jaw bone is growne in some measure sharpe, and the jaw in such sort is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, that it supplyeth in some manner the want of teeth, for the chewing of meate. But then, as the Preacher here speaketh, <hi>the sound of the grinding is low,</hi> the softnesse of the grinders maketh their noyse not heard, and yet they speak aloud to men, that their end is at hand. <hi>And he shall rise up at the voice of the bird:</hi> the Preacher here passeth unto the sense of hearing, and first shewing it to be quick in old age, afterwards sheweth the great dulnesse of it. First, so quick it is, that at the voice of a bird it is awakened: but this indeed is not the quicknesse of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:177008:215"/> but in truth the badnesse of the sleeping. For as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Hieronim. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>frigescente jam sanguine, &amp; humore siccato quibus materiis so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por alitur, ad levem sonitum evigilat, notisque medio quum gallus cecinerit exurgit, nequaquam valens strato saepius membra convertere,</hi> the blood now growing cold, and the moysture being dryed up, by which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters sleepe is nourished, it awakeneth with a little sound, and at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when the cock croweth, it riseth speedily, being not able of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to turne its members in the bed. <hi>Tully</hi> saith, that in sleeping, the sense of hearing is requisite,<note place="margin">Tull. de Natu. Deor. l. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> and serveth as an usefull means to awaken us: but that which youth needeth, old age needeth not, that wanteth sleepe, it wanteth not means to awaken it. <hi>And all the daughters of musick shall be brought low:</hi> the daughters of musick, are the many instruments of hearing, which being joyned, and married as it were to the sounds of the ayre, doe bring forth the delightfull hearing of musick, and other the like things. A good writer, comming to speake of the organs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, addresseth himselfe thus unto it; But here the difficulty of the taske which I am to undergoe, putteth mee to seek, and so I doe, the assistance of Almighty God, that he would set a edge upon my wit, to be able to pierce,<note place="margin">Rauhinus.</note> and to discover the wonders of his creation, the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his wisedome, and his infinite goodnesse, wherewith he hath invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned us. And that he would furnish me with abilitie cleerely to set forth and manifest to your apprehensions all those things which so vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and artificially are folded up, that it is hard for the eye to observe and follow the traine of them. The organ of hearing, in Latin is called <hi>auris,</hi> and as <hi>Lactantius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lactant.</note> will have it, <hi>ab hauriendis vocibus,</hi> from draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the voices and sounds unto it. But the parts of the eare being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they have also divers uses and offices: some being made as necessary to receive the sound, others as fit both to receive it, and to apprehend it, others as conducing both to the better receiving and perceiving of it, others as serving for the preservation and safety of all the rest. Generally the eare is divided into the outward and inward eare. The outward eare, which is spread abroad like unto a net, principally serveth to catch as it were the formes of sounds wandring through the ayre <hi>per vocalem undam,</hi> by a vocall wave, as <hi>Avicen</hi> speaketh, that so being there caught, they may from thence passe into the hole of the eare, as the fishes doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the narrow end of the net. The principall parts of the inward eare, are the drum, whose head is covered with a membrance, as a piece of vellome covereth the head of a drum, and which hath also a cord that runs through the middest of it, like the cord of a drum, the hammer, the anvil, the stirop, not like the stirrops now used, but like the old fashion of stirrops, which resembled the Greek letter Δ, the ovall window, the labyrinth, the snaile shell, the stony bone, the inplanted ayre, which is cleare, thin, without motion, without sound, of a good quantity, and not conjoyned to the outward ayre. But to leave these things to those to whom they doe belong, and which indeed, as they cannot be found out exactly, so should not be sought after too curiously. For it is fit
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:177008:215"/> that in Gods works, somthing should be the admiration of our silence, especially when our uncertaines conjecture do rather testifie a vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of satisfying our audacious phantasies, then yeeld any matter of importance and profit. As for the generall use of hearing, <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath observed it well, that by hearing, the things of others are made known to our selves, as by our voice and tongue wee are able to make known our own things to another. But when old age commeth, the glory of this most excellent worke is humbled, and <hi>brought low,</hi> the anvil is worne, the hammer is weake, the drum is unbraced, the pure ayre is growne thick, the musicke is marred, the dolefull toll of the passing-bell being ready to sound, and to ring out. Let this admonish us to have God in our company when we cannot goe abroad to the company of others, to make our selves a sweet savor in the nostrills of God, when our nostrils cannot perceive the sweetnesse of savours, to be watchfull in the wayes of God, that when we cannot sleepe, yet wee may rest in him, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend carefully in hearing of Gods Word, that when we cannot heare outwardly, yet may inwardly heare him speaking peace unto our hearts and consciences.</p>

And to the same purpose <hi>Tremellius</hi> saith, <hi>nullum erit tam aequabile solum, ubi, non metuant ab offensione &amp; attritu pedis,</hi> there is no ground so levell and even, where they may not feare the hurting and bruising of their foote. The originall word here here used is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifying <hi>attriti contriti,</hi> worn, wasted, as noting the weaknesse of old age, not only to be unable to goe up any ascent, but also to be quickly spent and wearied in going a little upon the plaine ground. But the meaning also of the word may be taken another way, and the Originall sounding thus, <hi>ab alto time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt,</hi> they shall feare from on high, <hi>Lyra</hi> apprehendeth it thus, that that shall be afraid, which is on high in man, and accordingly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, he saith; <hi>id est, superior pars animae, quia omnes naturaliter ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mortem propinquantem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>etiam secundum partem superiorem cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pori compatientem,</hi> that is, the superiour part of the soule, because all naturally doe feare death approching, even in the superiour part, which hath a fellow-feeling of the bodies corruption. Or else to follow our translation, the words may well guide us unto this meaning, that men are then afraid of that which is on high, that is, of God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing speedily to give an account to him of their lives, who will be a strict examiner of them, and a severe punisher of all that is amisse. This which should be the feare of all our lives, cannot but be the feare of old age. And then accordingly to expound the following words, <hi>and feares shall be in the way,</hi> that is, saith <hi>Lyra, quia timent exire viam vitae prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentis,</hi> because they feare to goe out of the way of this present life. Or else we may take it thus, <hi>feares shall be in the way,</hi> that is, when they lie upon their death bed, where they are gasping for breath, and even go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, they shall be full of fears, whither they shall goe, what shall become of them. <hi>And the Almond tree shall flourish,</hi> that is, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon exposition conceiveth it, and white haires shall flourish. And the reason, as I conceive, why by the flourishing of the Almond tree the white haires of old age are supposed to be understood, is because the Almond tree doth flourish, and is full of blossomes in the old age and winter of the yeare:<note place="margin">Plin. l. <hi>16.</hi> c. <hi>25.</hi>
                     </note> for as <hi>Pliny</hi> relateth, the Almond tree doth blossome in the moneth of January. But the originall word, which is translated flourish, is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which commeth from <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and have the letter א added unto it. Wherefore as I conceive, the word may here be taken, as signifying a refusing or contemning, and I take the Preacher to shew the decay of the sence of tasting in old age, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath shewed it in the other senses. First then he sheweth it, in that the fruit of the Almond tree, which no doubt is much esteemed where it groweth,<note place="margin">Plin. Ibid.</note> as being the first that is ripe. For <hi>Pliny</hi> also relateth that it is ripe in the moneth of March, yet by old age is refused and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. The most delicious fruite, and that which is most gratefull to
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:177008:216"/> the pallate, is not regarded by it. Secondly he shews it, in that <hi>the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopper shall be a burden:</hi> for though it may be taken, as shewing the weaknesse of old age, not being able to carry a very small burden, as it were no more then a grashopper: yet I conceive it rather to shew the weaknesse of digestion in old age, so that the pestle of a larke, or as the Preacher speaketh, no greater quantitie then a grashopper is a burden to it. And I the rather follow this meaning, because the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall word signifieth a locust, and it may bee, the same light and thin meate, which the Baptist did eate in the wildernesse, who is said to have eaten locusts and wild honey. <hi>Tremellius</hi> reads it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.4.</note>
                     <hi>pinguefacien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem se locustam,</hi> the locust making himselfe fat, and he taketh this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage and the former, as setting forth the spring-time,<note place="margin">Tremell. in hunc vers.</note> wherein the trees flourish, the living creatures rejoyce, which yet affecteth old age with no joy, no contentment. Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and the Vulgar Latine accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Septuagint, doe read it, <hi>impinguabitur locusta,</hi> the locust shall be made fat, and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronim.</note> expoundeth it to shew, <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num crura tumentia, &amp; podagrae tumoribus pregravata,</hi> the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling legs of old men, oppressed with the swellings of the goute. <hi>Lyra</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lyra.</note> expoundeth it to signifie <hi>ventrem tumescentem humoribus indigestis,</hi> the belly swelling with humours indigested. Thirdly, I conceive the Preacher to shew the decay of the sence of tasting, in shewing the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to be lost and gone, when he saith, <hi>and desire shall faile.</hi> The originall rendred <hi>desire,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which some render <hi>concupiscentia,</hi> lust or concupiscence, others <hi>aviditas</hi> greedinesse, others <hi>voluptas</hi> pleasure, others <hi>superbia</hi> pride, others <hi>appetius</hi> appetite. Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> and the Vulgar Latine according to the Septuagint do reade it <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paris,</hi> the fruite of capers, which <hi>Lyra</hi> expoundeth the concupiscence of the flesh, and saith that it is so called here, <hi>eo quod capparis est herba, quo luxuria excitatur,</hi> because <hi>Capparis</hi> is a plant by which lust is stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up. And indeed the Jewes doe understand the desire here spoken of to be the lust of the flesh. But saith <hi>Estius, Non decet castitatem Scripturae sacrae hoc referre pro incommodo senectutis, quod multi boni &amp; castitatis studiosi etiam in juventute exoptant,</hi> it doth not beseeme the chastity of sacred Scriptures, to reckon that for an inconvenience of old age, which many that are vertuous and lovers of chastitie,<note place="margin">Estius in hunc vers.</note> doe in their youth wish for. To which purpose he alleadgeth <hi>Cicero,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the commodities and benefits of old age, reckons up this, <hi>quod hominem a libidinis aestu veluti a tyranno quodam liberet,</hi> that it freeth man from the fire of lust, as it were from a certaine tyrant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith he, that interpretation doth rather please, which understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it of the failing of the appetite of feeeding, which capers doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke. And concerning the decay of the sense of tasting in old age, <hi>Barzillai</hi> shews it, when he saith to <hi>David,</hi> I am this day fourescore yeares old, and can I discerne betweene good and evill? Can thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant taste, what I eate, or what I drinke? <hi>Because man goeth to his long home:</hi> the originall is <hi>in domum</hi>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. <hi>Or ever:</hi> The Preacher here, as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> observeth, returneth unto his former speech, of remembring the Creatour in the dayes of youth, <hi>et post grande hyperbaton interjectum nunc caeptam sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam simili fine concludit,</hi> after a great transposing of his words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the plaine and Grammaticall order of them concludeth his matter began by him, with the like end. <hi>The silver coard be loosed:</hi> Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> understandeth the silver coard to be nothing else but the thred of life, <hi>candidam hanc vitam &amp; spiramen, quod nobis de caelo tribuitur,</hi> this white life and breathing, which from heaven is granted to us. <hi>Lyra</hi> by silver cord understandeth the harmony of the elements, in which they are tempered,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note> and mixed together in the body, and which by death is dissolved. But as I conceive, the Preacher having done with the head of man, he descendeth here unto the lower parts, and first, <hi>by the silver cord,</hi> I apprehend him to understand the spine bone, which from the neck is extended downe through the length of the back, in the middle of it, like a wreathed cord, and being hollow all along, hath treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in it that marrow, from whence the sinews for the most part are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived: and the better to preserve so great a treasure, it is exasperated with many processes, which are as it were the flancks of the bulwarke to keepe it from hurt. This cord is made of divers small bones, as it were of divers wreaths, and in a generall division, containeth foure parts; the necke, the backe, the loynes, the holy bone. The racks (for so the small bones are called) of the neck are seven, of
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:177008:217"/> the back twelve, of the loines five. The uppermost rack bone of the neck is called <hi>Atlas,</hi> because as he was faigned to beare heavē on his shoulders, so this beareth up the head, the heaven of the little world of mans body. The rack bones of the back are the same in number with the ribs doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, every rack bone having two ribs, of each side one, joyned unto it: &amp; though commonly the rackes of the back be twelve, yet sometimes they are but eleven, and sometimes they are thirteene, though that be not so often. The rack bones of the loynes are greater and thicker then any of the others. The holy bone hath its name, not for any holy mystery that is in it, which is the fond conceite of some, but as <hi>Homer</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Homer.</note> calleth great fishes <hi>pisces sacros</hi> holy fishes, the reason whereof may be, because the greatest beasts were used to be offered in sacrifices; so this is called the holy bone from the greatnesse of it, as being greater then any other of the bones of the spine. Or else, it may be, as the Apostle speaketh,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.13.</note> those members of the body, which we thinke to be lesse honorable, upon those we bestow more abundant honour. This silver coard is in a manner stretched out directly &amp; straightly, that it is bowed now inward, then outward. First the upper part called the neck is bowed inward, that the gullet might rest the better upon it. The second part of it, which is called the back, boweth outward, that so the organs of respiration might have the more roome. The third part of it which are the loines, turn &amp; bend againe inward, that the trunke of the hollow veine &amp; the great artery might be the better upheld by it. But when old age commeth, this <hi>cord is loosned,</hi> which maketh the head to hang downe, the back to bow, the whole body to bend to the earth, whether it is going. <hi>Or the golden bowle be broken:</hi> by the golden bowle or cup, I conceive the Preacher to signifie the heart, the figure thereof being pyramidall with the base of it upward, and the cone or pointe of it downeward not unlike unto a bowle cup, and having also two ears, one of each side of it, not unlike the ears of a cup, which are called the deafe ears of the heart, as not having any hearing vertue, but serving to this end, that the hast of ayre and blood pressing to come to the heart might by them be stayd, and by degrees admitted to have accesse. Or else we may take the bowle to bee the cover of the heart, which being also formed like the heart, is hollow like a bowle, and which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a pretious liquor and water in it, by which the heate of the heart is danitily and sweetly cooled and refreshed. For the heart being so hot of it self, that the left ventricle of it will even scald a mans finger put into it, and the continuall motion of it being a means to encrease the heate, this water serveth for the tempering and moderating of it. It was this water, which at our saviours passion, the percing sword made to issue with blood out of his side. But to take the bowle for the heart it self, it is said to be <hi>a golden bowle</hi> in regard of the substance of the heart, which is a solid, red, and a golden flesh, the thickest part of the blood being the matter of it. It is a paler red then that which is in the flesh of the Muscles, but more compact and firme, that the spirits and native heate which are in the heart, and from thence are powred out of the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:177008:218"/> bowle into all the parts of the body, might be there preserved, and that it might not be crackt or broken by the forcible moving of it, and as being continually either delated or drawen in. This flesh is indeed a <hi>golden</hi> matter, as having the vegetative facultie seated in it, and giving chiefly vertue to the heart to performe the offices of it, which depend principally upon the vitall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pirits and blood, and the making of them. But how well soever this flesh is compacted together, in old age the bowle getteth cracks, and at length by death is broken: at length the heart becommeth uselesse, as a broken bowle or cup. <hi>Or the pitcher be broken at the fountaine:</hi> next to the heart in man is the liver, and from hence it hath in Latin the name of <hi>jecur quasi juxta cor,</hi> as it were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced neere unto the heart. Wherefore in these words I conceive the liver to be meant, that being the shop of sanguification or bloodma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as one speaketh, or rather as the Preacher here speaketh, that being <hi>the fountaine</hi> of blood, from whence by the channels of the veines, it is carried over the severall provinces of mans body. For here arise those two great and long veines, the port or gate veine, and the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low veine, and which are multiplied into very many branches. The <hi>pitcher</hi> here is the body of the liver, which is not altogether unlike a pitcher, first being of severall formes as pitchers are, because the use of it needeth rather a convenient bignesse, then any proper figure: and then having two sides, wherof the outward is convex and turned round, the inward is hollow fit to receive something into it. The largenesse of it in man is greater then in any other creature of his proportion, and in the greatest men greatest: for the operations of mans soule being many, and in them many spirits being wasted and spent, and blood being the matter whereof the spirits are made, the liver therefore of necessity was to be the greater, that so the more blood might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, the whole body also from thence being to be furnished with it. But yet at length in old age <hi>the pitcher is broken,</hi> and as a broken pitcher holdeth little or no water, so that containeth little blood, from whence the veins being empty, way is made for death to enter in. <hi>Or the wheele bee broken at the cisterne:</hi> by these words I conceive the Preacher to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify the bladder, of which a good <hi>Anatomist</hi> speaking saith, that it is a large cistern or vessell. The Preacher here doth call it <hi>a wheele</hi> or orbe in respect of the roundnesse of it, from whence some have likened it unto a sphere. And <hi>the wheele</hi> or orbe is here said to be <hi>broken,</hi> for as much as the weakenesse of this part in old men maketh them unable to hold and keepe their water. These two latter passages the breaking of the pitcher,<note place="margin">Hieron. in hunc vers.</note> the breaking of the wheele, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> understandeth to be nothing else, but <hi>aenigmata mortis</hi> dark expressions of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as when these are broken there is noe longer drawing of water, so when death commeth there is no longer drawing of breath. <hi>Tremellius</hi> by all these understandeth nothing else, but the temporall goods of this world, as the chaines, the jewels, the household-stuff, which in this life are enjoyed and by death are taken away. For so he expoundeth,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:177008:218"/>
                     <hi>the silver cord, the golden bowle, the pitcher, the wheele;</hi> Lastly to apply the Preachers words unto a more spirituall use: <hi>remember thy creator,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his justice to feare, his mercy to hope, his bounty to be thankfull, his greatnesse to reverence him, his goodnesse to love him, his sweetnesse to hunger and thirst after him. And remember him, while thou art drawen with <hi>the silver cord</hi> of the doctrine of faith, while thou hast the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him in <hi>the goldē cup</hi> filled with his blood, which he shed for thy sins. Run unto God, hastē to the fountaine of wisedome, be diligent to fil thy <hi>pitcher,</hi> &amp; to drink of it being filled, lest the pitcher while it is empty be brokē at <hi>the foūtaine,</hi> &amp; not the water but thy self be lost for evermore.</p>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. When God made man, the originall, word for word speaks not as commonly it is translated, <hi>and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the earth:</hi> but thus is saith, <hi>the Lord God formed man dust of the earth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Genes.</hi> 2.7.</note> So that man is but earth in respect of his body, although changed curiously by the working of Gods hand, and although made of a different kind from the common earth. Wherefore the Preacher also here plainly cals it dust, saying, <hi>then shall the dust.</hi> And to consider this, saith Saint <hi>Basil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Basil. Homil. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>salutare quoddam emolumentum est adversus quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque peccatum,</hi> is a profitable help against every sin. But as for pride especially, what need of more to quell it, then to looke upon the earth from whence man was taken? surely as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh, <hi>etiamsi sexcenties supercilia▪ surrigamus, ea reprimemus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chrysost. Homil. <hi>12.</hi> in Genes.</note> although six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times we lift up our eye-browes, we cannot but cast them downe, by considering the condition of our first beginning. Wherefore Saint <hi>Basil</hi> saith very well, <hi>quid aspernabilius esse possit quam nos ipsi? Quid nobis occurrat dignius, quam ut nos humili dilectione exinaniamus?</hi> What can be more unworthy then we our selves are? What is more worthy in us, then that we disesteeme ourselves by a humble dejection? It had been nothing unto God to have made us of a finer and more excellent matter but as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh, <hi>materiae vilitas magis demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat artis copiam</hi> the vilenesse of the matter doth the more set forth the abundance of his art, who to earth and dust hath given so much beauty, and with such variety of senses and feeling hath adorned it. Besides God hath made our body earthy, that we might make it heavenly. For as he hath made the heaven and the earth, so he hath vouchsafed us this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that we may make the earth to be heaven. Wherefore Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>Corpus nobis finxit Deus ex terra,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chrysost. Homil. <hi>15.</hi> m. <hi>1.</hi> ad Tim.</note>
                     <hi>ut ipsum quoque sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vehamus in caelum; non ut per ipsum animam detrahamus in terram,</hi> God hath formed us a body out of the earth that we might carry it to heaven, not that by it we should pull downe the house unto the earth. <hi>Return to the earth:</hi> and let not the journy of it thither,<note place="margin">Hieron. contra vigilant.</note> the lodging of it there be disturbed and disquieted. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> arguing against <hi>Vigilantius</hi> sheweth that God himselfe did honour the body of <hi>Moses, dum illud propriis manibus sepelivit,</hi> while that he buried him with his own hands.<note place="margin">Calcin. Comm. in c. <hi>8.</hi> Actor.</note>
                     <hi>Calein</hi> also sheweth <hi>sepulturam honorem esse debitum corporibus sanctorum,</hi> that buriall is an honour due to the bodyes of the Saints. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:177008:219"/> the benefits, which from buriall arise unto the dead, setteth this downe for one, <hi>quod consulitur honori eorum adhuc in hominum memoriis viventium: non enim caret ignominia quadam, quod faeditas nostri cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris aliorum conspectibus pateat,</hi> that thereby is provided for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Purg. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. ult.</note> as yet living in the memories of men: for it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some reproach, that the loathsomnesse of our body lye open to the sight of others. But why then doe the Papists take the bones of the Saints out of their graves? Why doe they keepe them in boxes to be shewed to the people, to be handled by the clergy, to be carryed about in procession, to be set upon the Altars? <hi>Erasmus</hi> speaking of his travels, and relating the passages of it, of one place he saith, <hi>dictumirum, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ossium illic prolatum sit,</hi> it is wonderfull to tell how many bones were brought forth there, sculs, chins, teeth, hands, fingers, whole armes all which we adored and kissed;<note place="margin">In colloq. pereg. relig. ergo.</note>
                     <hi>nec erat futurus finis,</hi> neither would there have been end, unlesse the companion of my travels, when their was brought unto him an arme, which had yet bloody flesh on it, had been moved at it, and his countenance had manifested a kind of loathing of it. The Church of Rome may accompt this an honour done to the Saints, because their bones are laid up in boxes of gold or silver, but to make the best of it, what is it but <hi>insepulta sepultura,</hi> an unburied buriall,<note place="margin">Cicero Phil. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> which <hi>Cicero</hi> esteemed for a disgrace. Neither is it any such honour as in the Scriptures we find to have been given to the Saint. Suppose the bones of some dead Saint to have wrought a miracle, which is a thing, the Papists talke much of, and which seemeth in this point to have been the ground of their superstition: the bones of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elisha</hi> we are sure wrought a great miracle,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 13.21.</note> notwithstanding we doe not find that his bones were taken out of his sepulchre. But rather as <hi>Josiah</hi> commanded concerning the bones of another Prophet,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.18.</note> let him alone, let no one move his bones, so may we well thinke <hi>Elishaes</hi> bones were left at rest. Wherefore that <hi>Wiclevian</hi> no doubt was in the right,<note place="margin">Waldens. tom. <hi>3.</hi> tit. <hi>14.</hi> c. <hi>128.</hi>
                     </note> who as <hi>Waldensis</hi> reporteth, <hi>judicialiter confessus est,</hi> confessed openly at his tryall, that the flesh and bones of dead men ought not to be worshipped by the people, nor to be taken out of their unsavory monuments, nor to be layd up in golden or silver boxes. <hi>And the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit shall returne to God:</hi> the spirit dyes not, and therefore that returneth to God the fountaine of life. Hence the auncient Church did call the dayes on which the Saints of God dyed, <hi>natalia ipsorum,</hi> the dayes of their birth, because then they entred into that better life, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed true life, because then they go into that heavenly country, which is truly called the land of the living. And though in common speach we say of the Saints departed, that they are dead, that is only to put a difference betweene them, and the Saints which are not yet departed from the earth. For though the Church of Rome dispute, that the Godly in this life are not called Saints,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 8.28</note> yet it is plaine that the Spirit of God calleth them so, and their canonization and Saint making, is but a trick of their Church-merchandising. Every Spirit of man depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:177008:219"/> from his body, returneth unto God, but the Spirits of the wicked returne unto him to be sent from him by his just judgement into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments, the Spirits of the righteous returne unto him to abide with him in endlesse joy and happinesse. <hi>They returne to God,</hi> but they doe not returne to be made God, to be prayed unto, to have vows made unto them, to have trust and confidence reposed in them. This is more then they looke for being in heaven, and much more then should be given them by us, being on earth. <hi>Who gave it:</hi> Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> speaking of these words saith, <hi>ex quo satis ridendi sunt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>qui putant animas cum corpore seri &amp; non Deo sed à corporum parentibus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerari,</hi> from whence they are worthy to be laughed at, who think the soules to be sowed and generated of the seed together with the bodyes, and to be brought forth not by God, but by the parents of the bodyes. For seeing it is said, that God gave the Spirit, he thinks it to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that God is the Father of the soules and not men. And indeed Saint <hi>Austin</hi> writing of this argument, confesseth <hi>inter caetera testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, hoc esse praecipuum,</hi> among other testimonies for the proofe of it, this to be the chiefe. But yet Saint <hi>Austin</hi> in himselfe being doubtfull in this point, thinketh that the Preachers meaning may be, that as God made the first man out of the earth in respect of his body, which afterward by generation was to be brought forth; so that God himselfe made the first soule, which afterward was from man to be propagated. The good Father is most modest in writing of it, and whereas Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> had sent some unto him to be instructed in it, he tels us that he wrote back unto him, <hi>consulens &amp; petens, ut prius ipsum doceret,</hi>

Suppose a wise &amp; learned man to be travelling over the world for increasing of his knowledg, and hearing of a great University to take his way unto it: but when he commeth thither, to find in one Schoole taught the manner and skill of playing at cards, in another Schoole of playing at tables, in another of playing at bowles, and so the severall kinds of idle games and pastimes, how would he crye out folly of follyes all is folly; in like manner the Preacher having by his wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge travelled in his thoughts over the whole world, and having viewed in the things that are without man, the mutability, uncertainity, insufficiency of them to content mans heart; having beheld in man the blindnesse, of his mind, the perversnesse of his affections, the fading decay and corruption of his body, he cryeth out likewise <hi>vanity of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties all is vanity:</hi> that is all is nothing. Now as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh,

                     <hi>mirandum, sed magis dolendum quam mirandum, quod id quod nihil est amari potest,</hi> it is to be wondred at, but more to be lamented then wondred at, that that can be loved which is nothing.

                     <note place="margin">Bernardus Epist. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </note> hence we perceive plainly, whence, and whither we are come, what we have lost, what we have found. Him we have lost, in whom all things are contained: that we have found, in which all things that are contained are nothing: from him we are come, who alone truly is, thither we are come, where every thing that is, by vanity is not. And yet this we love him we despise. For as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> also speaketh, <hi>appetitus vanitatis, est contemptus veritatis,</hi> the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of vanity is the dislike of uerity. But as he likewise addeth, <hi>quid vanius quam diligere vanitatem? Quid iniquius quam contemnere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem?</hi> What more vaine, then to love vanity? What more wicked, then to despise verity? Neither let the worldling thinke it to be strang, that thus the Preacher maketh the things of this life, to be so meerly vanity, to be so plainly nothing.

                     <hi>quemadmodum amygdalae dicuntur inanes, non in quibus nihil est, sed in quibus id quod inest est inutile,</hi> almonds are said to be empty, not because there is nothing in them, but because that which is in them is unprofitable and to no use; so likewise the things of this world are said <hi>to be vanity,</hi> are said to be nothing, because how great soever they may be in their earthly magnitude, how glorious soever in their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary bravery, yet they are of no use for the procuring of true good unto man, no way profitable for the establishing of mans happinesse. But who is it that thus speaketh, <hi>vanity of vanities all is vanity?</hi> It is not man that saith it, for in him a love of this world makes him to thinke too highly of the things of the world. It is not the King that saith it, for in Kings the glory of the world maketh them unable to see the vanity of the things of the world. It is not <hi>Salomon</hi> that saith it, for he was deceived by the things of the world, and could not discerne the vanity of them. It is <hi>the Preacher that saith it,</hi> he that by study and care had looked into the truth of things he that had unmasked the outside of shewes and apparences, and had searched out, what the things of this life are, he saw, and he saith, <hi>that all is vanity,</hi> and what he saith, truth it selfe saith. Great is the authority, which here is given unto Preachers. The Prophets to give authority unto their words, use to say; <hi>Thus saith the Lord;</hi> but the Lord himselfe, the Holy Spirit of God to give authority to his Preachers words, here saith, <hi>Thus saith the Preacher. David</hi> was a great King in <hi>Israel,</hi> and he was a Prophet: but <hi>Salomon</hi> was a greater King, and he was a Preacher. He chose for his text this argument of the vanity of humane things, and saying here, <hi>saith the Preacher,</hi> seemeth to mee, to have set it downe, as one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and principall argument for Preachers to insist upon.

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. <hi>Moreover because the Preacher was wise he still taught,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein our translation followeth the reading of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> and though <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> also use the same as being most literall, yet as I conceive the force of the Originall is more kindly expressed by the French translation which readeth it thus, <hi>and by how much the Preacher was wise, by so much the more he taught the people.</hi> In both, the sense is very little different, and as I conceive, the Preacher here by his owne example sheweth the duety and office of a Preacher. By these words he teacheth them that are to teach others two things. First that himselfe must be wise that shall take upon him to teach others wisdome. This Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> observing upon that passage of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> who saith, <hi>and it came to passe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17</note>
                     <hi>at the end of seven dayes that the word of the Lord came unto mee saying, Son of man I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel,</hi> thereupon noteth, <hi>qui speculator futurus est, &amp; Dei verba po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo narraturus, multo tempore debet quiescere, ut scilicet à Deo accipiat &amp; discat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronim. Ibi.</note>
                     <hi>quae postea distribuere possit,</hi> he that is to be a watchman, and to declare the words of God unto his people, must be still and quiet a long time, that so he may receave and learne from God those things which he may disperse abroad. There is no art that is presumed to be taught before that it be learned, and shall any presume to teach in this great art, who are not first well learned? Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> speaking of Preachers saith, <hi>oculi sunt qui in ipsa honoris summi facie positi provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi itineris officium suscipiunt,</hi> they are eyes which are placed in the very face of the highest honour and take upon them the office of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the way,<note place="margin">Gregor. Past. Cu. p. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> and shall any thrust themselves into this place this office, which have not the cleare sight of knowledge in them? Secondly the Preacher teacheth here that the abilities of teaching ought to cause every one to teach, and that the more ability he hath, the more paines he is to take in it. But as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> noteth, there are not a few, who being enriched with great gifts, <hi>dum solis contemplationis studiis inardescunt, parere utilitati proximorum predicatione refuguunt,</hi> while they burne in the studies of contemplation, only, doe shun to yeild in Preaching to the profit of their neighbours. Of whom he giveth this judgement, <hi>ex tantis proculdubo reisunt, quantis venientes ad populum prodesse potuerunt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregor. Pasti. Cu. p. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> they are guilty no doubt of so much evill, as by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth from their retirednesse into the world they might have done good. And is it not sometimes the judgement of God upon them, as the same Father noteth, <hi>dum sua &amp; non aliorum lucra cogitant, ipsi se quae pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vata habere appetunt,</hi> that they <hi>bonis privant,</hi> deprive themselves of those
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:177008:221"/> good things which they desire to have private to themselves. <hi>Yea he gave good heed:</hi> Saint <hi>Hieorme</hi> reads it, <hi>&amp; audire eos fecit,</hi> and he made them to heare. <hi>Pagnine</hi> and <hi>Arias Montanus, &amp; auscultare fecit,</hi> and he made them to hearken, as shewing his desire to be the profit of the hearers: and let every one who desireth to please God in this calling make this his chiefe desire. But to consider the words as our transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath them. <hi>He gave good heed,</hi> that is, he was carefull so to teach,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2.</note> as to take his fittest opportunity for it. Indeed Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Preach the word, be instant in season, out of season:</hi> but as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> noteth <hi>dicturus importunè praemisit opportune, quia scilicet apud auditoris men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ipse sua se utilitate destruit, si habere importunitas opportunitatem nescit,</hi> being about to say out of season, he first saith in season, because importunity if it know not how to use opportunity doth often destroy it self by its owne profit. Yea not only is the vertue lost of that which is said when by an indiscreet unseasonablenesse of loquacity, it is disestee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the hearts of the hearers: but as the same Father speaketh,<note place="margin">Gregor. past. cu. par. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem suum haec eadem loquacitas inquinat quae servire auditoribus ad usum profectus ignorat,</hi> the same loquacity disgraceth the authour of it, when that it knoweth not to how to be serviceable for the profit of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. <hi>And sought out:</hi> the Originall word is in <hi>Pihel</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and as I suppose may be translated, as that before is translated by Saint <hi>Hierome fecit investigare</hi> he made them to seek out, or to search into, as shewing that the Preacher so taught as that he made the people to understand what he taught, and to see into the truth of it. And surely it must be the care of a Preacher to apply his matter and speach to the capacity of the hearers, that so there attention may be able to seek into it, and so search it out. In the law of the Jews he that hath digged a pit was to cover it, least an oxe or an asse should fall therein;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.33.</note> and it must be the care of him who by paines of study strength of understanding hath searched into the secrets of religion not to utter them heedlesly, least that an oxe or asse some unlearned and simple hearer fall into errour and hurt by it. The pit therefore is to be covered, and high knowledge before plaine heares is to be concealed, least while the doctrine of the teacher is lifted up on high, the weaknesse of the hearers should stumble and dash its foote below. In the Scripture it is ordinary by the clouds to signify Preachers, and Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> considering those words of <hi>Job, he bindeth up his waters in the thick clouds,</hi> there upon he saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job.</hi> 26.8.</note>
                     <hi>ut audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores rudes non inundatione scientiae obruantur, sed moderata praedicationis distillatione foveantur, ligat Deus aquas in nubibus: quia doctorum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicationem temperat, ut auditorum infirmitas doctorum rore nutrita con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valescat,</hi> that plaine hearers may not be overwhelmed with an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowledge, but that they may be cherished with a moderate distillation, he bindeth the waters in the clouds;<note place="margin">Gregor. Moral. l. <hi>17.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note> for he tempereth the preaching of the teachers, that the weaknesse of the hearers being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by their dew may grow strong by it. Wherefore it is a good rule which the same Father giveth, <hi>dignum est ut qui praedicet audientis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:177008:222"/> consideret, quatenus sua praedicatio cum auditoris sui incrementis crescat,</hi> it is meete that the Preacher consider the condition of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that so he may teach higher matters as his hearers are riper in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. But to understand the words, of the Preacher himselfe alone, and as our translation hath it, <hi>and sought out,</hi> they shew his study and diligence to find out that, which he might teach the people. For a Preacher must as well labour, and by meditation seek what to teach, as reach, and deliver that which he hath found, he must as well draw out of the fountaine, as powre out that which he hath drawn. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> therefore saith, <hi>perfectus doctor Dei est docibilis &amp; dum pascere cibo alios nititur, ipse multiformium delitiarum spiritualium dulcedine satiatur,</hi> he that is one of Gods carefull teachers,<note place="margin">Gregor. m. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> is himselfe teachable, and whiles he endeavoureth to nourish others with food,<note place="margin">Sam. c. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> he is diligent to fill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the sweetnesse of manifold spiritual delights. The staves where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Ark was to be born were alwayes to be in the Ark, they were not to be taken out from it:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.15.</note> and what are Preachers but as it were the staves of the Ark, whereby the Church of God is born up? wherefore as the staves were alwayes in the Ark, so saith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> it behooveth teachers <hi>semper in suis cordibus eloquia sacra meditari, ut si quicquid ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse sit testamenti arcam sine mora elevent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregor. Past. Cit. p. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>protinus doceant,</hi> alwayes in their hearts to meditate upon the sacred scriptures, that if need doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, they may without delay take up the Ark of the testament, they may fortwith teach. <hi>And set in order many proverbs:</hi> to set things well in order doth set them out well, and in teaching it is therefore very needfull, because it is very helpfull. It was a ladder which Jacob saw reaching from earth to heaven, wherein by degrees the steps do follow in order, one after the other. And surely a good order in teaching doth best serve to bring downe the graces of Gods spirit from heaven, doth best serve to lead up the lives of men, to have there conversation in heaven. And for the order of teaching, let me note one thing from <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Genes.</hi> 28.12.</note> of which it is said, he saw the Angels, of God ascending &amp; descending on it. The Angels of God being in heaven, one would think that it should have been first said descending and then ascending: but seeing it is first said ascend and then descend, let the Preachers of God who are his Angels sent unto his people learn this order, that first they ascend by prayer unto God to beg his blessing upon their labour, before that they descend by teaching to instruct the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. <hi>The Preacher sought:</hi> this repetition of the Preachers see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king induceth me the rather to conceive the seeking in the verse before of the peoples seeking, to which the Preacher exhorted them. The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall word here also used for seeking is not the same, that in the verse before it is. Here it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which signifieth to seek by suing and praying, to seek by asking direction and counsel of them who are able to give it. And surely thus must a Preacher seek, he must not be ashamed to aske counsel, where he standeth in need of it, and especially he must sue and seek to God for his assistance and blessing. For as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> saith
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:177008:222"/> well, <hi>necesse est ut si vere intendimus illuminata cernere, studeamus men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis oculos ad ipsum illuminans lumen aperire,</hi> it is necessary if we verily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to behold those things, which are illuminated,<note place="margin">Gregor. Moral. l. <hi>23.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> that we endeavor to lift up the eyes &amp; mind of our to open them unto the light it self by which they are illuminated. <hi>Sought to find out:</hi> there is still somthing to be sought out by a Preacher, and still must a Preacher be seeking to find. For that I may deliver the common sentence of the <hi>Philosopher</hi> in Saint <hi>Gregoryes</hi> words, <hi>in hoc mundo dum vivimus, tunc perfectè quae scienda sunt scimus, quum proficientes per intelligentiam nihil nos perfectè scire co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoscimus,</hi> while we live in this world, then doe we know perfectly those things, which are to be known, when as profiting in understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we know that we know nothing perfectly. <hi>Acceptable words:</hi> Saint <hi>Austins</hi> direction is, <hi>agat vir eloquens, ut intelligenter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">August. de doct. Christ. l. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>ut obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter audiatur,</hi> let it be the endeavour of an eloquent man, that he may be heard with understanding, with willingnesse, with obedience. And to this end it is that a Preacher is to find out <hi>acceptable words,</hi> such words as may procure an understanding, willing, obedient attention. The originall is as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reads it <hi>verba voluntatis,</hi> words of the will,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 2.26.</note> that is such words as are agreable unto the will of God, and are of power to work upon the will of men for their good and benefit. Of <hi>Samuel</hi> it is sayd that he was in favour both with the Lord and with men; and such must be the words of a Preacher, as that they be <hi>acceptable</hi> to God and to men. Unworthy is it a Preachers pains to seek to please men only: and what is it but as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Gregor. in Ezek. l. <hi>2.</hi> Homil. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>rem magnam vili pretio venundare</hi> to sell a pretious thing for a vile price? He is worthy of that name who as the same Father speaketh, <hi>ea quae dicit ideo placere ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus appetit ut dum placet, quod dicitur, per eadem dicta non ipse sed Dominus ametur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregor. in Evang. Hom. <hi>17</hi>
                     </note> desireth that those things which he speaketh may be acceptable to men to this end, that while that is pleasing which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, not himselfe but the Lord may be loved by the speeches. <hi>And that which was written, was upright.</hi> Our translation and the French also understand this part of the verse, as speaking of that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten here in this book, but the Originall speaks no more, then the <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of uprightnesse,</hi> and sheweth the Preachers care and diligence not only by speaking but by writing also to instruct the people- And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed speaking is but like a burning coale, which giveth heate and some light neere at hand, but writing is like a shining lampe, which giveth light far off. But that which the Preacher principally intendeth, is that Preachers must be carefull both in speaking and writing to deliver the words of <hi>uprightnesse the words of truth.</hi> The words of <hi>uprightnesse</hi> in shewing the right way to God, in discovering the wrong wayes of sin. The words of truth, in setting forth the truth of God, in refuting and rejecting the errours of men. First the words of <hi>uprightnesse,</hi> they must not spare to shew men their dueties, to tell men there faults. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Preacher having mentioned <hi>acceptable words,</hi> he addeth words of <hi>uprightnesse</hi> as shewing that they must be so acceptable, as withall not
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:177008:223"/> neglecting to presse unto <hi>uprightnesse</hi> of life, and to blame what is a misse therein. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> therefore writing to <hi>Nepotian</hi> saith, <hi>docente te in Ecclesia non clamor populi, sed gemitus suscitetur, lachrymae auditorum laudes tuae sint,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. ad Nepotian.</note> when thou teachest in the Church, let not the applause of the people, but their sighing be stirred up by thee, let their tears be thy prayses.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hosea.</hi> 4.8.</note> The Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> speaking of bad teachers saith, they eate of the sin of my people, which Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> expoundeth <hi>vivunt ex peccatis populi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in Hoseam.</note> they live by the sins of the people, they make the means of their living to be the greater by suffering the people to live in their sins without reproose. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> expoundeth it, <hi>peccata de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquentium fovent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gregor. in Evang. Hom. <hi>17</hi>
                     </note> they nourish the sins of offenders, and as themselves are nourished by the meate which they eate, so by their carelesnesse, they nourish the people in there wickednesse, which should be destroyed by them.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 13.17.</note> In which respect the words of Preachers should be arrows, peircing the soule of sinners, and wounding them with griefe unto the heart, so that it may be sayd of them, as <hi>Elisha</hi> said of the arrow of <hi>Ioash, the arrow of the Lords</hi> deliverance. And surely it were good, if hearers would even open their breast,<note place="margin">Origen. Homil. <hi>2.</hi> in Cantic.</note> and as <hi>Origen</hi> speaketh <hi>transfigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum praeberent hujusmodi jaculis,</hi> would even offer it to be periced with these arrows. The wounds which these arrows make, are as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nyssen</hi> calleth them, <hi>praeclara vulnera,</hi> excellent wounds: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed what are they but even sweete wounds by which not death but life enters into their secret parts.<note place="margin">Gregor. Nyssen. Homil. <hi>4.</hi> in Can.</note> But in shooting these arrows let it be the ayme of Preachers to shoote only at the vices of men, not at the men themselves. The history is of <hi>Alcon</hi> the <hi>Cretian,</hi> that when a dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon hath taken away his son, he killed the Dragon with his arrow, but did not hurt his Son and it was his naturall affection that put his art into him, of whom it is well said, <hi>ars erat esse patrem,</hi> it was his skill that he was a father. And let Preachers shew themselves to be fathers in their great love, killing the brood of the Dragon, sin in the hearers, but not hurting them by any ill affection toward them. <hi>Words of truth:</hi> secondly the Preacher here sheweth that it must be the care of Preachers to instruct the people in <hi>the words of truth,</hi> and that their words must be so acceptable, as that being true likewise, they may make the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to understand, what is the truth of religion. <hi>Lactantius</hi> noteth that the doctrine of <hi>Epicurus</hi> was chiefly followed,<note place="margin">Lactant.

                     <hi>non quia veri aliquid afferebat, sed quia multos ad populare nomen voluptatis invitabat,</hi> not because it afforded any truth, but because it invited many to the popular name of pleasure: and so it is with some Pteachers, who are much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, not because they deliver that which is truth, but because that pleaseth the hearers which is delivered by them. Such a one Saint <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> describing saith, <hi>qui magna de se sentiens sed vera de Domino igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi>

But it must be the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:177008:223"/> care of good Preachers to withstand such, to shun their practise, to oppose their falshood, and to teach nothing but the words of truth. Lastly it may be noted here that the words <hi>of uprightnesse, and the words of truth</hi> must be joyned together: there must be a diligence as well to illighten the understanding in the knowledge of truth, as to direct the will a right in the wayes of vertue. The Lord saith in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. The words of the wise are as goades: that is, to admonish and tell them of their errours, that goe out of the way; to quicken and stirre up those that are slow and dull in the way. And as if these things were a marke shewing, which are the words of the wise, Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, <hi>Si cujus ergo sermo non pungit, sed oblectationem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>facit audientibus, iste non est sermo sapientis: verba quippe sapientum pungunt, ut stimuli,</hi> if therefore the speech of any one doe not prick, but cause delight unto the hearers, that is not the speech of one that is wise: for the words of the wise doe pricke as goads. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> therefore saith, <hi>accipe non diserta sed fortia,</hi>

                        <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.32.</note> Wherefore when it is said of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas, that they exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them,</hi> the Syriack reads it not <hi>verbo plurimo,</hi> with many words, but <hi>verbo divite,</hi> with rich words, as if it would expresse the rich ornaments that were in the treasure of their words. But to consider the word, as here our translation readeth it, <hi>fastned,</hi> it sheweth, that as the words of the wise, being goads, doe bring wanderers into the way, and hasten dullards in the way, so they doe settle them also in the right way, that they doe not easily loose the way againe. But these words whieh are rendred here, <hi>by the masters of the assemblies,</hi> in the originall doe afford divers translations. The <hi>Venetian</hi> translation reads it thus, <hi>and like nayles firmly fastned, sustinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus collectam supellectilem,</hi> holding up the furniture that is gathered together, to adorne the house, taking the sense of the words from the metaphor of the nailes which the Preacher useth. The French transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reads it thus, <hi>les maistres qui ont fait des recueils, the masters who have made the gatherings, are as mailes fastned,</hi> as shewing the sense to be, that the words of the wise having gathered and recalled men from wandring, and being themselves as nailes fastened and established in the right way of vertue, doe also by their example strengthen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm others in it. <hi>Tremellius</hi> reads it <hi>lectissima</hi> most choice words, as shewing that the words of the wise are gathered out and chosen and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the occasion, for the matters, for the persons, when, whereof, to whom they are delivered. But as I conceive there are two things here not unworthy to be considered of: first that the originall word here used is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the gathering of those things, which are not dispersed: wherefore it may seeme here to import rather the gathering of men back from their sinfull courses, by the words of the wise as goads pricking them, as nayles peircing them, and fastning upon them. The other thing to be considered is, that these words in the originall may be as well joyned with that which followeth after, as with that which goeth before. <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> pins them to the end of the verse,<note place="margin">

The <hi>Jewes</hi> say as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> relateth, that whereas among other bookes of <hi>Solomon</hi> which are lost and antiquated, this booke also should have been put away, because it affirmed the creatures of God to be vaine, and made all to be as it were nothing and preferred meate and drinke and fading delights before all things else,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> yet from this one verse it obtained authority to be placed in the number of divine bookes because the Preacher shuts up his whole disputation and all his discours, with this summary conclusion, that the end of all speaking is this, <hi>to feare God and to keep his commandements. Let us heare the conclusion of the whol matter:</hi> the Originall word by word goeth thus, <hi>the end of the whol matter is heard:</hi> wherefore S. <hi>Hierome</hi> to expresse the force of it reads it thus, <hi>auditu perfacilis est,</hi> is easy to be heard. And indeed it seemeth to imply, that he would say was very short and that it would quickly
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:177008:226"/> be heard, even so quickly as if it were already heard before that it were spoken. So that the words may seeme to carry this sense, you have heard me thus far, while that I have with many words spoken unto you, I will now ease your hearing, and end my speaking, if I may but say one word more. <hi>Feare God:</hi> there are many kinds of feare, a wordly feare, when a man rather then to forsake his owne contentment and ease, cares not to forsake God by forsaking his commandements: against which our Saviour Christ exhorteth saying, <hi>feare not them which kill the body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>but are not able to kill the soule: but rather feare him who is able to destroy both body and soule in hell.</hi> A naturall feare, which Saint <hi>Basil</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Basil.</note> saith, is the gift of God, the ornament of nature, by which we are warned and in some sort armed for the avoyding of evill, that may befall us.<note place="margin">August.</note> A servile feare, which Saint <hi>Austin</hi> defineth to be that, whereby goodnesse is not loved, but punnishment is only feared: and yet this is a good feare also. Wherefore Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ambros.</note> saith that the gloriours martyrs by this feare, the feare of hell torments where stength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against the torments invented by man:<note place="margin">Tertull.</note> and this feare saith <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> is the instrument of repentance, the bridle of lust.

                        <hi>Prover.</hi> 1.7.</note> to which we may apply those words in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> the feare of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: and which St. <hi>Basil</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Basil.</note> cals an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory feare, to lead us on to the more religious serving of God, so that it is composed partly of a servile partly of a filiall feare. Lastly there is a feare filial, a fear of God, as he is our Father, &amp; wherby we are solicitous not to loose his favour, not to be deprived of his blessing. This by some is called <hi>reventialis timor,</hi> a reverencing feare, by others a chast feare, because it is like the feare of a chast wife, who feareth to loose her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands love:<note place="margin">Hieronym. in hunc vers.</note> or else a chast and pure feare, as not mixed with a worldly and carnall feare. Now of this feare which Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> cals <hi>consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum in virtutibus metum,</hi> a feare perfected in vertues, doth he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this place, because the Preacher saith, that it is <hi>omnis homo</hi> the whole man. Or else he seemeth to understand the place of a servile feare, because it is said that this is <hi>omnis homo,</hi> that this is every man, this feare of God being inbred in every man. <hi>Feare God and keepe his commandements:</hi> man consisteth of two parts, his body and his soule, these two make up a whole man in nature, and here are two parts that make up a whole man in grace. <hi>The feare of God</hi> is as it were the body, <hi>the keeping of his commandements</hi> is as it were the soule. <hi>Lyra</hi> doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them thus,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>the feare of God</hi> saith he, is to depart from evill, <hi>the keeping of his commandements</hi> is to be exercised in doing good, and these two parts of righteousnesse doe make up a perfect man in vertue. Or else we may distinguish them thus, <hi>to feare God,</hi> is in our hearts to serve him and honour him, <hi>to keepe his commandements</hi> is the outward demonstration of this inward devotion,<note place="margin">Ludolphus de vita Christi.</note> in the conversation and actions of our lifes to shew our selves his servants. <hi>For this is the whole duety of man:</hi> the Originall is no more then this, <hi>hoc est omnis homo</hi> this is every man. Some make up the sense thus, <hi>hoc, id est ad hoc</hi> this, that is to this,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:177008:226"/> to this end was every man made, doth every one live. Others make it up thus, <hi>hoc, id est per hoc,</hi> this, that is by this is every man, as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Preacher to shew, that this makes man <hi>to be,</hi> which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per glory of God. <hi>Quia quod Deus est per essentiam hoc etiam est obediens per participationem,</hi> because that which God is by his essence,<note place="margin">Rupertus.</note> he that is obedient is also made by participation and grace, by which we are made partakers of the divine nature. And as by obedience every man <hi>is,</hi> so the disobedient is one that is not. According as the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> sheweth, who speaking of the disobedient saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4.25.</note>
                     <hi>I looked and loe there was no man.</hi> Our translation maketh up the sense thus, <hi>this is the whole duety of man:</hi> and seeing the scope and drift of the Preacher in this booke is to shew the happinesse and chiefe good of man, perhaps it may not amisse be made up thus, this is the whole happinesse of man. But to take the words simply as the Originall hath set them downe, <hi>hoc est omnis homo,</hi> this is all man, that is saith <hi>Lyra, hoc est totus sive perfectus homo</hi> this is the whole or perfect man. For as the <hi>Philosopher</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">Lyra in hunc vers.</note>
                     <hi>totum &amp; perfectum sunt idem,</hi> the whole and a thing perfect are one and the same thing. Wherefore saith <hi>Lyra,</hi> the tearme of that which is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally whole, is used here for that which is integrally whole, there being but one word in the Hebrew toung,<note place="margin">Arist. Metaph. <hi>5</hi>
                     </note> which is used to signifie both of them. Or else if we will take it as yet more literally, and take the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> for <hi>omnis</hi> as it signifieth <hi>all</hi> universally, so that we conceive the Preacher to import, that this is the very nature and essence of man; even in this manner also it may be not improperly construed. For what is the nature of man, but to be <hi>animal rationale,</hi> a reasonable living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? And what is more reasonable then <hi>that God should be feared, and his commandements kept by man?</hi> what can be more unreasonable, then that the creature should deny this reverence &amp; obededience to God his creatour?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. <hi>For God:</hi> judgement belongeth unto God, man must take heed how he meddle with it. Wherefore Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> saith judge nothing before the time,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.5.</note> untill the Lord come who will bring to light the hidden things of darkenesse, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise of God. For as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith very well, upon those words, <hi>injuria judicis est si ante cognitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ejus, à servo procedat judicium,</hi> it is a wrong to the judge,<note place="margin">Ambros.</note> if before he heare and know the cause, judgement be given by a servant. And being a wrong to the judge, it cannot but be a mischiefe to him that shall doe it. Wherefore good is the counsell of <hi>Paschasius, declinemus ad praesens sententiam, subtrahamus judicium, dicamus totum Deo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Paschas. l. <hi>2.</hi> Matthae.</note>
                     <hi>ne dum temere gestimus definire sententiam, nobis paremus ex discrimine alieno rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> for the present let us shun to give sentence, let us forbear to judge, let us say, let God doe all, lest while we rashly desire to give sentence, we bring upon our selves ruine from anothers danger. <hi>God shall bring:</hi> loath is guilty man to come into judgement, and therefore he cryeth to the hils to cover him to the mountaines to fall upon him: but moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:177008:227"/> and hils and all shall forsake him and God shall bring him to it. The best way therefore is, of our selves before hand to goe unto his judgement, and in our owne hearts to arraigne our selves before God for that it is which will make his judgement to be comfortable to us. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaking of some saith, <hi>they looked unto him and were light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and their faces were not ashamed.</hi> And surely they who looke unto God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.5.</note> and doe now behold him sitting upon his judgement seate, and consider themselves as standing before him to give an accompt of their lives unto him, they are they who when God shall bring them to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall be illigthned with joy, and shall not have their faces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. For as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh, <hi>diligit Deus animam quae in conspectu ejus, sine intermissione considerat, &amp; sine dissimulatione diju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat seipsam,</hi> God loveth that soule, which in his sight as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermission considereth, as without dissimulation judgeth it selfe. <hi>God shall bring every work:</hi> not only the bad works of the wicked, but the good works of the righteous, as from the last words of the verse may also be gathered. In the seventy fifth Psalme the second verse we read it, <hi>when I shall receive the congregation, I will judge rightly,</hi> but the Originall is <hi>rectitudines judicabo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bernard. Serm. <hi>3.</hi> in Advent.</note> I will judge the rightnesse of things, and the vulgar Latin reads it <hi>justitias judicabo,</hi> I will judg the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of things. Whereupon <hi>Hugo Cardinalis</hi> saith, <hi>terribile verbum, quod non tantum peccata sed &amp; justitias judicabit, bona scilicet opera exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minabit,</hi> it is a terrible word,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.2.</note> that he will not only judge sins, but the righteousnesse of things, and will examine the good works of men. <hi>Every work</hi> of every man will he bring to judgement, even those which now seeme to be little, and not worthy the taking notice of. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>O Lord thou hast searched me and knowne me, thou knowest my downe sitting and mine uprising.</hi> It is not said thou knowest me,<note place="margin">Hugo Cardinal.</note> whither I sit or whither I rise, but thou knowest my very downe sitting, and mine uprising: thou takest notice how these are performed by me, whether my sitting be idle, or else profitable, whether my uprising be to the actiōs of goodnes or works of inquity: thou takest notice what I doe amisse, even in the very doing of these: thou takest notice, where, when, how, and to what end either I sit downe or else arise up. And these with every thing else <hi>will God bring to judgement.</hi> Wherefore in the Revelation when Christ is described sitting in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is said <hi>to have a sickle in his hand:</hi> it is not said a scepter, but a sickle, that being a compassing instrument and gathering in every thing,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ps.</hi> 139.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.</note> because then no worke shall be left out, but God shall gather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very work and bring it into judgment. <hi>Into Judgement</hi> with men there are diverse judgements, and oftentimes very needfull that the latter may correct the errours of the former: but with God there is but one. The last is the first, and the first is the last: his judgement being perfect, and not subject to any errour. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> hath a saying, <hi>Nihil plenius, quam quod extremius. Deus itaque judicabit plenius, quia extremius per sententiam aeternam supplicii,</hi> there is nothing more full, then that
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:177008:227"/> which is last. God therefore will judge fully, because it will be his last judgement, by the eternall sentence of punnishment.<note place="margin">Tertullian. de Anima.</note> So that after this one judgement there is no hope of another, that shall give ease of mercy to them that are condemned by it. <hi>With every secreet thing:</hi> the words which we read of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> writing, <hi>we must all appeare before the judgement seate of Christ,</hi> doe not only import, that we must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare and be present: but that we must there appeare plainly and fully what we are. For the Orginall Greeke is <gap reason="foreign">

No sin is now comitted so covertly, so cunningly, but then it shall be evident and naked unto the sight of all. Wherefore when <hi>God</hi> saith to <hi>Cain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.10.</note>
                     <hi>if thou dost not well sin lyeth at the dore, Hugo Victorinus</hi> expounding it saith, <hi>peccatum quod est in foribus ut exeat, prava voluntas est, quae non potest celari quin aliquando exeat &amp; appareat aliquo signo,</hi> sin which lyeth at the dore that it may go forth, is an evill will, which cannot be hid, but sometime or other getteth out &amp; appeareth by some signe or other. And surely how secret soever any wickednesse may be, it lyeth at the dore, &amp; shall at last get out, if not in this world, yet at the judgement day of God, and then shall shew it selfe to all. There are some secret sins in the best of Gods servants, which themselves cannot find out though they search never so diligently. But at the judgement day every secret sin,<note place="margin">Hugo Victorin.</note> even these also shall be manifested. Wherefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, I know nothing by my selfe, yet am I not therefore justified, but he that judgeth me is the Lord: and thereupon <hi>Anselme</hi> saith, <hi>tanta est profunditas in homine ut lateat ipsum hominem in quo est, sed Dominum latere non potest,</hi> so great is the depth that is in man that it is hid from man in whom it is, but it cannot be hid from the Lord. <hi>Every secret thing</hi> containeth also the secret graces and vertues of men, which perhaps there owne humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity discerned not, nor were seen by others:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Corith.</hi> 4.4.</note> as also the secret workes of Religion and devotion which the shunning of ostentation and vaine-glory in the world concealed, al shal then be brought forth to Gods glory &amp; their comfort who then shal reape the fruit of them. <hi>Whether it be good or evill,</hi> that is, every thing shall then be shewed what it is, whether it be good, or whether it be evill, and by the severall reward of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall kind of it shall be fully declared. Wherefore in the <hi>Revelation</hi> also the seate of the judge,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Revelat.</hi> 14.14.</note> is not said to be a throne of silver or gold or pretious stones, <hi>but a cloud:</hi> now in a cloud, as there is the desired raine which refresheth the earth, and nourisheth the fruits of it, so there is hayle and lightning which hurt the ground, and destroy the fruits thereof. In like manner therefore from this judgement seate shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed both sweet showers of endlesse blessednesse upon the good, and lightning and tempest of eternall damnation upon the evill and wicked▪</p>
